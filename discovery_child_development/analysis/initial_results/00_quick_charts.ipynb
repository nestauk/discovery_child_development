Today, the biggest problem in the correct classification of waste is that people do not have the awareness of recycling. In this direction, a smart recycling box that will bring this awareness to people from childhood is an effective solution. Today, in order to raise awareness of recycling in children, activities are organized in preschool or primary school periods to develop children&#39;s love of nature and skills to protect nature within the scope of MEB education programs, and the types of objects and wastes we use in daily life are taught and the benefits of waste recycling are explained. Children are taken to waste collection/separation factories in order to show the difficulties in sorting wastes and to show through which processes the separated wastes are recovered. After teaching the difficulty and importance of collecting wastes by classification, a picture of the relevant waste class is pasted on each bin in a way that appeals to children, and a waste bin with 4 bins (paper, glass, plastic, metal) is put in the classrooms. However, the reason why such studies are insufficient is that there is nothing to show the children the truth when the waste is thrown into the wrong bin. Based on this, it is the aim of this invention to design a waste bin that will reward children when they do right and show them the truth when they do wrong. This project is different from other works; with the help of an embedded deep learning waste box, to determine whether the waste is put into the right hopper and to prevent the waste placed on the wrong side from entering the hopper. The main difference of this patent work is to guide the child with entertaining and educational videos with the help of the LCD screen to put the waste on the wrong side to the right side, to bring the waste to the right hopper and to share a rewarding reaction. Thus, it is aimed to raise awareness of recycling by educating people who are the main problem of waste recycling at a young age. The waste bin to do this will have 4 chambers (paper, glass, plastic, metal) and the opening and closing of the chamber lids will be provided with the help of servo motors. With the help of cameras that see each hopper cover, the image of the waste put into the hopper will be obtained and inserted into a trained deep neural network. A previously trained deep neural network will be retrained using the transfer learning method. In order to realize this training, at least 2500 waste images (waste that children can use in classrooms) will be obtained with the help of a good camera, which will constitute the data set to be used. The training of the network will take place in the Python program and this trained network will be embedded in the Raspberry Pi 4B. The working principle of the system is as follows: After the waste is placed on the lid of the relevant chamber, the image will be taken with the help of the camera and passed through the deep neural network, and the object will be classified and the system will recognize the waste. Then, one of the two options given below will be realized: -If the waste is put in the wrong chamber, the lid of the chamber will not be opened and the instructions that will direct the child to the right box will be made with the help of the LCD screen. - If the waste is placed in the correct chamber, the lid of the chamber will be opened and it will fall into the waste bin, and a reaction will be given with the help of the LCD screen, in which the child will be praised.\", \"url\": \"https://patents.google.com/patent/TR2022010973A2\"}, {\"x\": -3.7110071182250977, \"y\": 4.498887062072754, \"source\": \"patents\", \"cluster\": 5, \"cluster_name\": \"Deep learning for infant care\", \"cluster_description\": \"This cluster captures innovations in infant care and monitoring through deep learning technology, including methods for recognizing infant behaviors, diagnosing baby health, detecting dangerous situations, and developing intelligent baby monitors.

Early childhood anxiety has been linked to an increased risk for developing mood and anxiety disorders. Little, however, is known about its effect on the brain during a period in early childhood when anxiety-related traits begin to be reliably identifiable. Even less is known about the neurodevelopmental origins of individual differences in childhood anxiety.We combined structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging with neuropsychological assessments of anxiety based on daily life experiences to investigate the effects of anxiety on the brain in 76 young children. We then used machine learning algorithms with balanced cross-validation to examine brain-based predictors of individual differences in childhood anxiety.Even in children as young as ages 7 to 9, high childhood anxiety is associated with enlarged amygdala volume and this enlargement is localized specifically to the basolateral amygdala. High childhood anxiety is also associated with increased connectivity between the amygdala and distributed brain systems involved in attention, emotion perception, and regulation, and these effects are most prominent in basolateral amygdala. Critically, machine learning algorithms revealed that levels of childhood anxiety could be reliably predicted by amygdala morphometry and intrinsic functional connectivity, with the left basolateral amygdala emerging as the strongest predictor.Individual differences in anxiety can be reliably detected with high predictive value in amygdala-centric emotion circuits at a surprisingly young age.

The researchers assessed different aspects of cognitive development: general intellectual ability, declarative memory, procedural memory, executive function, academic achievement, fine motor dexterity, and socioemotional health. The associations were assessed in three different samples from the original pregnancy cohort: a representative sample, a sample of malnourished mothers at recruitment, and a sample of women with anaemia at recruitment. The procedural memory outcome differed between the MMN and the iron and folic acid groups in the random sample, and general intellectual ability in the anaemia sample. These possible effects of prenatal MMN on school age child development were small but a bit more prominent in the anaemia sample. The gathering of evidence of the relative strength of effects for the micronutrients, and of associations with other biomedical and socioenvironmental conditions for development is commendable. Socioenvironmental conditions such as parental education, socioeconomic status, home environment, and maternal depression seemed to be more important determinants than the biological determinants measured. Will a foetus that is hungry in the womb be satisfied by multiple micronutrients? The rationale behind the multiple micronutrients as compared with the recommended iron and folate when being developed by WHO, UNICEF and the UN University for trial purposes, was the notion that different micronutrient deficiencies often occur together. But macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies also occur at the same time and in the same individuals. In the paper by Prado and colleagues, the MMN supplementation had no effect on child development in the subsample of undernourished mothers. This outcome could indicate that for women who also had insufficient intake of macronutrients before or during pregnancy, the prenatal multiple micronutrients had no effect on the child's cognitive development at school age. Is it safe to give only multiple micronutrients when food intake is insufficient? Earlier reviews have shown that in settings without skilled attendance at delivery, the MMN supplementation might increase the risk of neonatal death by asphyxia.4Haider BA Yakoob MY Bhutta ZA Effect of multiple micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy on maternal and birth outcomes.BMC Public Health. 2011; 11: S19Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar A study in Nepal documented increased frequency of asphyxia when the mother had been supplemented with MMN.5Christian P Darmstadt GL Wu L et al.The effect of maternal micronutrient supplementation on early neonatal morbidity in rural Nepal: a randomised, controlled, community trial.Arch Dis Child. 2008; 93: 660-664PubMed Google Scholar In Bangladesh, prenatal MMN increased the occurrence of stunting up to 5 years6Khan AI Kabir I Ekstrom E-C et al.Effects of prenatal food and micronutrient supplementation on child growth from birth to 54 months of age: a randomized trial in Bangladesh.Nutr J. 2011; 10: 134Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and decreased the IGF1 levels.7Ekstrom E-C Lindstr\\u00f6m E Raqib R et al.Effects of prenatal micronutrient and early food supplementation on metabolic status of the offspring at 4.5 years of age.

Method Participants ( N = 1,322) were drawn from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study (Straker et al., 2017). A general developmental screener, the Infant Monitoring Questionnaire (Squires, Bricker, &amp; Potter, 1990), was completed by caregivers at the 3-year follow-up. Language ability at 10 years old was assessed using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals\\u2013Third Edition (Semel, Wiig, &amp; Secord, 1995). Logistic regression models and interpretable machine learning algorithms were used to assess predictive abilities of early developmental milestones for later language outcomes. Results Overall, the findings showed that prediction accuracies were comparable between logistic regression and machine learning models using communication-only performance as well as performance on communication and broader developmental domains to predict language performance at 10 years old. Decision trees are incorporated to visually present these findings but must be interpreted with caution because of the poor accuracy of the models overall. Conclusions The current study provides preliminary evidence that machine learning algorithms provide equivalent predictive accuracy to traditional methods. Furthermore, the inclusion of broader developmental skills did not improve predictive capability. Assessment of language at more than 1 time point is necessary to ensure children whose language delays emerge later are identified and supported.

In particular, we propose the development of a mental health risk algorithm for the early detection of mental disorders with the potential for high public health impact that applies and adapts methods innovated in and successfully applied to early detection of cardiovascular risk. Specifically, we propose methods to advance risk prediction of early developmental psychopathology by creating synthetic cohorts that contain complete behavioral and neural data in the first years of life, as the basis for a robust and generalizable risk algorithm. The application of computational approaches within synthetic cohorts, an approach increasingly applied in psychiatry, may be particularly well suited to advancing risk prediction in early childhood mental health. We propose new research directions using these methods to generate an early childhood mental health risk calculator that could significantly advance early mental health risk detection to direct preventive intervention and/or need for more intensive assessment within a pragmatic framework for maximal clinical utility. The availability of such a tool in early childhood, a period of high neuroplasticity, holds promise to reduce the burden of mental disorder by identifying risk early in the clinical sequence and delivering prevention that targets the neurodevelopmental vulnerability phase.\", \"url\": \"https://openalex.org/W2977222280\"}, {\"x\": 2.4463491439819336, \"y\": 1.7080968618392944, \"source\": \"openalex\", \"cluster\": 3, \"cluster_name\": \"Machine learning for child development\", \"cluster_description\": \"This cluster captures innovations in using machine learning and predictive models to assess and predict various aspects of infant and child development, including health, cognitive outcomes, language development, and risk factors for conditions like asthma and obesity.

An initiative of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the knowledge integration project (http://kiglobalhealth.org) aims to improve global child health by promoting and supporting knowledge sharing among researchers. While the project has much broader potential, it began with and still has a primary focus on child growth and development. Such a focus is well warranted, since even with all today's modern advances in science and health, approximately a quarter of the world's children suffer from impaired growth due to nutritional deficiencies and other environmental factors.1 The project has created and continues adding to an impressive repository of data from studies conducted all over the world. Using this rich resource, researchers can gain a clearer picture of global trends and the factors that affect child birth and subsequent development, as well as improve their understanding of global variability in child health outcomes. Many of the studies in the repository have a longitudinal design, with children assessed repeatedly from birth and, in a couple of cases, even during the prenatal period. Physical growth, reflected through anthropomorphic measurements such as length or height, weight, and head circumference, is seen as a key factor in large part because it is well known that children with poor growth patterns early in life are at risk of a range of adverse health conditions in later childhood and adulthood.2, 3 Much of the early work in the project focused on the nontrivial task of amassing, organising, annotating, and making available the complex suite of data assets that had been contributed. Many conversations were held with various study investigators, hashing out important issues regarding protection of privacy and confidentiality, as well as policies around coauthorship. Given the size and complexity of the data, it was challenging for researchers to easily get a clear sense of what was available in the repository. This led to the development of a variety of innovative tools for exploring the project metadata and visualising the actual data (see http://kiglobalhealth.org/tools/). Over time, the strategy for engaging the many involved researchers also evolved and these days involves the use of \\u201cdata science rallies\\u201d that draw on the principles of agile software development, bringing together a team to tackle a specific question with intense effort over a short period of time. While not necessarily \\u201cbig data\\u201d in the sense of pure volume, modern data science tools and ways of thinking are a necessity when it comes to accessing the complex and diverse data available in the repository. It is no surprise that the project has unearthed a wealth of very interesting statistical challenges, particularly related to the analysis of longitudinal growth data in young children; hence, it was decided to bundle together several papers on the topic in this special issue. The first two special issue papers by Ohuma and Altman4, 5 address the question of how to best construct age- and gender-adjusted reference growth charts. Such charts are the basis through which parents might learn from the paediatrician that their child is, for example, in the 95% for length (or height for older children) and 90% for weight. Use of such standardised scores makes it much easier to monitor a child's growth trajectory over time. The first paper by Ohuma and Altman4 reviews the approaches that have routinely been used, based on cross-sectional data, to construct reference growth charts and then propose some extensions to the longitudinal setting. As illustration, they use data from the INTERGROWTH-21 project,6 which also includes prenatal head circumference data. The second paper by Ohuma and Altman5 draws from their experience with the INTERGROWTH-21 study to offer design guidelines. The third and fourth papers in the special issue address the question of how to model repeated standardised growth measures in a longitudinal setting.7, 8 Anderson et al7 discuss the challenge of how to decide when there is evidence that a child has faltered in their growth, based on two successive standardised scores. In order not to be biased by regression to the mean, the difference between the successive scores needs to be adjusted by a term that reflects the correlation between the two measurements. Building on principles of meta-analysis, the authors build a correlation matrix based on data from sixteen different studies from the repository. Anderson et al8 tackle the related question of how to best model a child's growth trajectory. They find that statistical models based on standardised scores (as opposed to length or height in centimetres or inches and weight in kilograms or pounds) tend to be easier to fit and less prone to model misspecification because they do not need to include potentially complex age and gender terms. Tim Cole, one of the world's leading experts in the analysis and modelling of child growth data, provides some interesting and provocative commentary on all four papers.9 The author is grateful to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for their vision in establishing the knowledge integration project as well as for support through Grant number OPP1126975.\", \"url\": \"https://openalex.org/W2950576350\"}, {\"x\": 1.882672905921936, \"y\": -0.9422011971473694, \"source\": \"openalex\", \"cluster\": 1, \"cluster_name\": \"AI in education\", \"cluster_description\": \"This cluster of documents focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in early childhood education, exploring how AI can enhance learning experiences and develop children's skills.

Abstract Background The early life risk factors of childhood obesity among preterm infants are unclear and little is known about the influence of the feeding practices. We aimed to identify early life risk factors for childhood overweight/obesity among preterm infants and to determine feeding practices that could modify the identified risk factors. Methods A total of 338,413 mother-child pairs were enrolled in the Jiaxing Birth Cohort (1999 to 2013), and 2125 eligible singleton preterm born children were included for analyses. We obtained data on health examination, anthropometric measurement, lifestyle, and dietary habits of each participant at their visits to clinics. An interpretable machine learning-based analytic framework was used to identify early life predictors for childhood overweight/obesity, and Poisson regression was used to examine the associations between feeding practices and the identified leading predictor. Results Of the eligible 2125 preterm infants (863 [40.6%] girls), 274 (12.9%) developed overweight/obesity at age 4\\u20137 years. We summarized early life variables into 25 features and identified two most important features as predictors for childhood overweight/obesity: trajectory of infant BMI (body mass index) Z -score change during the first year of corrected age and maternal BMI at enrollment. According to the impacts of different BMI Z -score trajectories on the outcome, we classified this feature into the favored and unfavored trajectories. Compared with early introduction of solid foods (\\u2264 3 months of corrected age), introducing solid foods after 6 months of corrected age was significantly associated with 11% lower risk (risk ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.97) of being in the unfavored trajectory. Conclusions The trajectory of BMI Z -score change within the first year of life is the most important predictor for childhood overweight/obesity among preterm infants. Introducing solid foods after 6 months of corrected age is a recommended feeding practice for mitigating the risk of being in the unfavored trajectory.\", \"url\": \"https://openalex.org/W3041721999\"}, {\"x\": -2.570460319519043, \"y\": 4.938849925994873, \"source\": \"openalex\", \"cluster\": 4, \"cluster_name\": \"AI in early childhood\", \"cluster_description\": \"This cluster captures innovations in early childhood education by utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning to personalize curriculum, assess language levels, predict language development, and analyze infant behavior for improved learning outcomes.

Four aspects of sensorimotor contingency detection are considered: characteristics of action and feedback, contingency parameters, exposure conditions, and interindividual differences. For each topic, we highlight what favors and what hinders the detection of sensorimotor contingencies in infants. Our review also demonstrates the limitations of our knowledge about sensorimotor contingency detection.

Over 250 million children in developing countries are at risk of not achieving their developmental potential, and unlikely to receive timely interventions because existing developmental assessments that help identify children who are faltering are prohibitive for use in low resource contexts. To bridge this \\\"detection gap,\\\" we developed a tablet-based, gamified cognitive assessment tool named DEvelopmental assessment on an E-Platform (DEEP), which is feasible for delivery by non-specialists in rural Indian households and acceptable to all end-users. Here we provide proof-of-concept of using a supervised machine learning (ML) approach benchmarked to the Bayley's Scale of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (BSID-III) cognitive scale, to predict a child's cognitive development using metrics derived from gameplay on DEEP. Two-hundred children aged 34-40 months recruited from rural Haryana, India were concurrently assessed using DEEP and BSID-III. Seventy percent of the sample was used for training the ML algorithms using a 10-fold cross validation approach and ensemble modeling, while 30% was assigned to the \\\"test\\\" dataset to evaluate the algorithm's accuracy on novel data. Of the 522 features that computationally described children's performance on DEEP, 31 features which together represented all nine games of DEEP were selected in the final model. The predicted DEEP scores were in good agreement (ICC [2,1] > 0.6) and positively correlated (Pearson's r = 0.67) with BSID-cognitive scores, and model performance metrics were highly comparable between the training and test datasets. Importantly, the mean absolute prediction error was less than three points (<10% error) on a possible range of 31 points on the BSID-cognitive scale in both the training and test datasets. Leveraging the power of ML which allows iterative improvements as more diverse data become available for training, DEEP, pending further validation, holds promise to serve as an acceptable and feasible cognitive assessment tool to bridge the detection gap and support optimum child development.\", \"url\": \"https://openalex.org/W3034802098\"}, {\"x\": 0.9234241843223572, \"y\": 3.9112637042999268, \"source\": \"openalex\", \"cluster\": 3, \"cluster_name\": \"Machine learning for child development\", \"cluster_description\": \"This cluster captures innovations in using machine learning and predictive models to assess and predict various aspects of infant and child development, including health, cognitive outcomes, language development, and risk factors for conditions like asthma and obesity.

Therefore, this paper aimed to determine the nature of factors influencing the efficacy variability of a particular intervention technique i.e., \\u201cPlay-based communication and behavior intervention\\u201d (PCBI). Methods: The participants comprised 70 13\\u201330-month-old toddlers with ASD enrolled in PCBI for 12 weeks.

Video recordings of 5 min of free-play before and after PCBI were used to examine behaviors of mothers and children and parent-child dyadic synchrony. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses and machine learning algorithms were performed to explore the effect of these potential predictors (mothers' factors, children's factors and videotaped mother-child interaction) of intervention efficacy. Results: The hierarchical regression analysis and the machine learning algorithms indicated that parenting stress, level of completion of training at home and mother-child dyadic synchrony were crucial factors in predicting and monitoring the efficacy of PCBI. Conclusions: In summary, the findings suggest that PCBI could be particularly beneficial to children with ASD who show a good performance in the mother-child dyadic synchrony evaluation. A better dyadic mother-child synchrony could enhance the PCBI efficacy through adapted emotional and behavioral responses of the mother and the child and has a beneficial influence on the child's psychological development.\", \"url\": \"https://openalex.org/W3107786879\"}, {\"x\": 1.8742680549621582, \"y\": -1.8378701210021973, \"source\": \"openalex\", \"cluster\": 1, \"cluster_name\": \"AI in education\", \"cluster_description\": \"This cluster of documents focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in early childhood education, exploring how AI can enhance learning experiences and develop children's skills.

As improvements in medicine lower infant mortality rates, more infants with neuromotor challenges survive past birth.

Thus, analyzing one of these domains - the motion of young infants - can yield insights on developmental progress to help identify individuals who would benefit most from early interventions. In the presented data collection, we gathered day-long inertial motion recordings from N = 12 typically developing (TD) infants and N = 24 infants who were classified as at risk for developmental delays (AR) due to complications at or before birth. As a first research step, we used simple machine learning methods (decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines) to classify infants as TD or AR based on their movement recordings and demographic data. Our next aim was to predict future outcomes for the AR infants using the same simple classifiers trained from the same movement recordings and demographic data. We achieved a 94.4% overall accuracy in classifying infants as TD or AR, and an 89.5% overall accuracy predicting future outcomes for the AR infants. The addition of inertial data was much more important to producing accurate future predictions than identification of current status.

Machine learning is a class of algorithms able to handle a large number of predictors with potentially nonlinear relationships. By applying machine learning to obesity, researchers can examine how risk factors across multiple settings (e.g., school and home) interact to best predict childhood obesity risk. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of studies that have applied machine learning to predict childhood obesity using a combination of sociodemographic and behavioral risk factors. The objective is to summarize the key determinants of obesity identified in existing machine learning studies and highlight opportunities for future machine learning applications in the field. Of 15 peer-reviewed studies, approximately half examined early childhood (0-24 months of age) determinants. These studies identified child's weight history (e.g., history of overweight/obesity or large increases in weight-related measures between birth and 24 months of age) and parental overweight/obesity (current or prior) as key risk factors, whereas the remaining studies indicated that social factors and physical inactivity were important in middle childhood and late childhood/adolescence. Across age groups, findings suggested that race/ethnic-specific models may be needed to accurately predict obesity from middle childhood onward. Future studies should consider using existing large data sets to take advantage of the benefits of machine learning and should collect a wider range of novel risk factors (e.g., psychosocial and sociocultural determinants of health) to better predict childhood obesity. Ultimately, such research can aid in the development of effective obesity prevention interventions, particularly ones that address the disproportionate burden of obesity experienced by racial/ethnic minorities.\", \"url\": \"https://openalex.org/W3135772869\"}, {\"x\": -0.22047817707061768, \"y\": 2.168693780899048, \"source\": \"openalex\", \"cluster\": 3, \"cluster_name\": \"Machine learning for child development\", \"cluster_description\": \"This cluster captures innovations in using machine learning and predictive models to assess and predict various aspects of infant and child development, including health, cognitive outcomes, language development, and risk factors for conditions like asthma and obesity.

Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most common chronic childhood disease, with nearly 1.8 billion new cases per year worldwide. ECC afflicts approximately 55% of low-income and minority US preschool children, resulting in harmful short- and long-term effects on health and quality of life. Clinical evidence shows that caries is reversible if detected and addressed in its early stages. However, many low-income US children often have poor access to pediatric dental services. In this underserved group, dental caries is often diagnosed at a late stage when extensive restorative treatment is needed. With more than 85% of lower-income Americans owning a smartphone, mobile health tools such as smartphone apps hold promise in achieving patient-driven early detection and risk control of ECC.This study aims to use a community-based participatory research strategy to refine and test the usability of an artificial intelligence-powered smartphone app, AICaries, to be used by children's parents/caregivers for dental caries detection in their children.Our previous work has led to the prototype of AICaries, which offers artificial intelligence-powered caries detection using photos of children's teeth taken by the parents' smartphones, interactive caries risk assessment, and personalized education on reducing children's ECC risk. This AICaries study will use a two-step qualitative study design to assess the feedback and usability of the app component and app flow, and whether parents can take photos of children's teeth on their own. Specifically, in step 1, we will conduct individual usability tests among 10 pairs of end users (parents with young children) to facilitate app module modification and fine-tuning using think aloud and instant data analysis strategies. In step 2, we will conduct unmoderated field testing for app feasibility and acceptability among 32 pairs of parents with their young children to assess the usability and acceptability of AICaries, including assessing the number/quality of teeth images taken by the parents for their children and parents' satisfaction.The study is funded by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, United States. This study received institutional review board approval and launched in August 2021. Data collection and analysis are expected to conclude by March 2022 and June 2022, respectively.Using AICaries, parents can use their regular smartphones to take photos of their children's teeth and detect ECC aided by AICaries so that they can actively seek treatment for their children at an early and reversible stage of ECC. Using AICaries, parents can also obtain essential knowledge on reducing their children's caries risk. Data from this study will support a future clinical trial that evaluates the real-world impact of using this smartphone app on early detection and prevention of ECC among low-income children.PRR1-10.2196/32921.\", \"url\": \"https://openalex.org/W3199934193\"}, {\"x\": 1.9468129873275757, \"y\": 1.3573429584503174, \"source\": \"openalex\", \"cluster\": 3, \"cluster_name\": \"Machine learning for child development\", \"cluster_description\": \"This cluster captures innovations in using machine learning and predictive models to assess and predict various aspects of infant and child development, including health, cognitive outcomes, language development, and risk factors for conditions like asthma and obesity.

BackgroundThere is an urgent need to fill the gap of scalable cognitive assessment tools for preschool children to enable identification of children at-risk of sub-optimal development and to support their timely referral into interventions. We present the associations between growth in early childhood, a well-established marker of cognitive development, and scores on a novel digital cognitive assessment tool called DEvelopmental Assessment on an E-Platform (DEEP) on a sample of 3-year old pre-schoolers from a rural region in north India.MethodsBetween February 2018 and March 2019, 1359 children from the Sustainable Programme Incorporating Nutrition and Games (SPRING) programme were followed up at 3-years age and data on DEEP, anthropometry and a clinical developmental assessment, the Bayley's Scale of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition (BSID-III) was collected. DEEP data from 200 children was used to train a machine learning algorithm to predict their score on the cognitive domain of BSID-III. The DEEP score of the remaining 1159 children was then predicted using this algorithm to examine the cross-sectional and prospective association of growth with the DEEP score.FindingsThe magnitude of the concurrent positive association between height-for-age and cognitive z-scores in 3-year olds was similar when cognition was measured by BSID-III (0.20 standard deviations increase for every unit change in specifically age-adjusted height (HAZ), 95% CI = 0.06\\u20130.35) and DEEP (0.26 CI, 0.11\\u20130.41).

This study aims to discover underlying patterns in ECDC utilization among Ohio Medicaid-insured children, which have significant implications for public health prevention, innovative service delivery models, and targeted cost-saving interventions. Methods: Using 9 years of longitudinal Medicaid data of 24,223 publicly insured child members of an accountable care organization ( ACO ), Partners for Kids in Ohio, we applied unsupervised machine learning to cluster patients based on their cumulative dental cost curves in early childhood (24\\u201360 months). Clinical validity, analytical validity, and reproducibility were assessed. Results: The clustering revealed five novel subpopulations: ( 1 ) early-onset of decay by age (0.5% of the population, as early as 28 months), ( 2 ) middle-onset of decay (3.0%, as early as 35 months), ( 3 ) late-onset of decay (5.8%, as early as 44 months), ( 4 ) regular preventive care (67.7%), and ( 5 ) zero utilization (23.0%). Patients with early-onset of decay incurred the highest dental cost [median annual cost ( MAC ) = $9,499, InterQuartile Range ( IQR ): $7,052\\u2013$11,216], while patients with regular preventive care incurred the lowest dental cost (MAC = $191, IQR: $99\\u2013$336). We also found a plausible correlation of early-onset of decay with complex medical conditions diagnosed at 0\\u201324 months. Almost one-third of patients with early-onset of decay had complex medical conditions diagnosed at 0\\u201324 months.

Conclusion: Among Ohio Medicaid-insured children, five subpopulations with distinctive clinical, cost, and utilization patterns were discovered and validated through a data-driven approach. This novel discovery promotes innovative prevention strategies that differentiate Medicaid subpopulations, and allows for the development of cost-effective interventions that target high-risk patients.

Additionally, legislative effectiveness of the bill\\u2019s primary sponsor was a strong predictor of legislative success, and further moderated the relation between bill content and passage. Highly effective legislators who had previously passed five or more bills had an extremely high probability of introducing a legislation that successfully passed regardless of topic. Legislation with expenditures as policy priorities benefitted the most from having an effective legislator.

Rapid weight gain (RWG) in the first 6 months of infancy contributes to childhood obesity. Suboptimal sleep-wake patterns and gut microbiota (GM) have also been associated with childhood obesity, but little is known about their influences on early infant RWG. Sleep may alter the GM and infant metabolism, and ultimately impact obesity; however, data on the interaction between sleep-wake patterns and GM development on infant growth are scarce. In this study, we aim to investigate associations of infant sleep-wake patterns and GM development with RWG at 6 months and weight gain at 12 months. We also aim to evaluate whether temporal interactions exist between infant sleep-wake patterns and GM, and if these relations influence RWG.The Snuggle Bug/ Acurrucadito study is an observational, longitudinal study investigating whether 24-h, actigraphy-assessed, sleep-wake patterns and GM development are associated with RWG among infants in their first year. Based on the Ecological Model of Growth, we propose a novel conceptual framework to incorporate sleep-wake patterns and the GM as metabolic contributors for RWG in the context of maternal-infant interactions, and familial and socio-physical environments. In total, 192 mother-infant pairs will be recruited, and sleep-wake patterns and GM development assessed at 3 and 8 weeks, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postpartum.

The study will apply machine learning techniques combined with logistic time-varying effect models to capture infant growth and aid in elucidating the dynamic associations between study variables and RWG.Repeated, valid, and objective assessment at clinically and developmentally meaningful intervals will provide robust measures of longitudinal sleep, GM, and growth. Project findings will provide evidence for future interventions to prevent RWG in infancy and subsequent obesity.

Potential reasons for this prevalence include the physical activity transition of AI people to sedentary lifestyles, in utero exposure to diabetes, and social determinants of health, especially poverty. In 2013, 29.8 percent of single-race AI/Alaska Native people were living in poverty. Childhood trauma and stress have also been linked to obesity.

It was evident from the start that tackling a challenge as complex as this would require collaboration of experts from a variety of disciplines including global mental health, developmental pediatrics, developmental psychology, neuroscience and computer science, all working closely with engineers and designers who could fashion the assessments onto mobile devices and present them in formats which are engaging for young children.Working across these silos did pose some challenges such as the discomfort of having expertise which was only part of the solution, implicit hierarchies about which expertise was more salient, and difficulties in communication due to differing concepts and vocabularies.Looking ahead, we hope to continue to leverage new resources and partnerships to realize our ultimate goal of scalable, valid assessments of early child development. The failure of hundreds of millions of children to achieve their full developmental potential or having their development disrupted due to neurodevelopmental disorders is a formidable barrier to a healthier, more equal, and inclusive future for humanity (Lu et al., 2016Lu C. Black M.M. Richter L.M. Risk of poor development in young children in low-income and middle-income countries: an estimation and analysis at the global, regional, and country level.Lancet Glob. Health. 2016; 4: e916-e922https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(16)30266-2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). One major reason for the limited global response to this challenge, despite the accumulation of evidence on effective interventions (Aboud and Yousafzai, 2015Aboud F.E. Yousafzai A.K. Global health and development in early childhood.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2015; 66: 433-457https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-010814-015128Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), is the absence of a pragmatic and valid tool for assessing early life neurodevelopment (Boggs et al., 2019Boggs D. Milner K.M. Chandna J. Black M. Cavallera V. Dua T. Fink G. Kc A. Grantham-McGregor S. Hamadani J. et al.Rating early child development outcome measurement tools for routine health programme use.Arch. Dis. Child. 2019; 104: S22-S33https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2018-315431Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The current dependence on observation of a child in a clinical setting by highly trained child development experts, an extremely scarce and inequitably distributed human resource, and the reliance on proprietary tools that are prohibitively costly effectively means that there is no routine assessment of child development, such as what is done for growth, in any low- and middle-income country. If developmental surveillance is implemented at all, it is done using parent-report questionnaires, which depend on the caregiver's own knowledge of healthy development in childhood, or observations by trained non-specialists, which differ based on the level of skill of the observer and which need continuing fidelity monitoring to ensure sustained quality through repeated intensive training. Indeed, in most settings, the health system simply waits for a child's development to become so awry that the consequences become visible to the parent, teacher, or health worker. As a result, the precious developmental window for early intervention is squandered and millions of children struggle with their learning, which, in turn, leads to poorer employment prospects and, ultimately, fuels the vicious cycle of disadvantage and poverty. The authors, Vikram Patel (a global mental health expert), Gauri Divan (a developmental pediatrician), and Supriya Bhavnani (a neuroscientist), along with a clinical psychologist and two neurobiologists, formed a small team that explored how their respective fields could collaborate to solve this challenge. In this backstory, they feature the tools that they have developed to easily assess early-life neurodevelopment that required the convergence of diverse disciplines. With the increasing accessibility of digital technologies, we challenged ourselves to consider whether we could innovate to close this monitoring and detection gap by designing scalable assessment tools. This approach was inspired by three strands of science:\\u2022implementation science demonstrating the success of task-sharing, a strategy in which paraprofessionals are trained to deliver specific health care interventions, for other global health challenges, including parenting interventions for promoting early child development and managing neurodevelopmental disorders (Britto et al., 2017Britto P.R. Lye S.J. Proulx K. Yousafzai A.K. Matthews S.G. Vaivada T. Perez-Escamilla R. Rao N. Ip P. Fernald L.C.H. et al.Nurturing care: promoting early childhood development.The Lancet. 2017; 389: 91-102https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31390-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar);\\u2022neuroscience, which showed how diverse technologies such as eye-tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) could be used to assess the developing brain;\\u2022developmental science, which showed that tasks delivered in a structured, engaging manner, typically with toys, could be used for direct assessments of child development. Thus, we aimed to design technology-driven tools that could provide direct assessments of the child's developmental capabilities (as opposed to parent reported or observed behaviors) and that could be delivered by frontline workers in home settings to realize our goal. We began this effort by adapting methods used in clinical settings and neuroscientific laboratory-based studies to assess cognitive, social-communication, and motor development into scalable tools by harnessing the potential of digital technology (see Figure 1). These adaptations included digitizing and gamifying neuropsychological tests such that they could be administered on relatively low-cost Android tablet computers, which automatically record the child's performance on the test. We proposed to use computer vision analysis of videos recorded by the camera of the tablet computer to replace both infrared eye-tracking as well as manual coding of videos of parent-child interaction. We also wished to explore the potential of noninvasive measures of brain activity using portable EEG. Our guiding principles were to design tools to be modular, which could work offline at the time of administration to address connectivity barriers, could be delivered in home settings, be seamlessly integrated with one another, and be amenable to the use of cutting-edge machine learning analysis methods to allow for triangulation of data from diverse sources. It was evident from the start that tackling a challenge as complex as this would require collaboration of experts from a variety of disciplines including global mental health, developmental pediatrics, developmental psychology, neuroscience, and computer science, all working closely with engineers and designers who could fashion the assessments onto mobile devices and present them in formats that are engaging for young children. This convergence of disciplines and expertise offered a unique opportunity to work across different perspectives that overlapped with one another in unexpected ways. For example, how game designers whose primary interest was engaging children's attention to play on digital devices coincided with the science team's interest in designing digital tasks that could serve to assess a range of neurodevelopmental traits. Working across these silos did pose some challenges such as the discomfort of having expertise that was only part of the solution, implicit hierarchies about which expertise was more salient, and difficulties in communication due to differing concepts and vocabularies (much of it, we would discover, was scientific jargon, which could be broken down into easily understood phrases). We overcame these challenges by emphasizing the critical value of each perspective and expertise to realize our goals, ensuring representation of all disciplines at every stage of the project, contributing to the planning, execution, analysis, and dissemination of our research and minimizing the use of discipline-specific terminology, instead focusing on the guiding principles of our work. Our program of work, which was launched in 2015, has grown to evolve into a growing international and interdisciplinary \\u201cTranslational Neuroscience Network\\u201d focused on child development (Figure 2). This network comprises like-minded academics drawn from Indian and international institutions, who recognize the potential for such cross-disciplinary collaboration to shift the needle on one of the most vexing of all scientific challenges. This network represents a highly effective collaboration between leading organizations including medical schools, universities, and civil society organizations in the global north and south. Our first step was an ideation and proposal creation workshop in December 2015, which served as the foundation of our first grant applications in which we proposed the digital delivery of neuropsychological tests of child development and tablet-based eye-tracking as promising technological innovations. The initial knocks from proposal rejections was replaced by optimism when we received support for pilot projects, which allowed us to create our first digital assessment tools\\u2014the Developmental Assessment on an E-Platform (DEEP; https://sangath.in/reach-2/) funded through the Corporate Social Responsibility grant from Madura Microfinance Limited (an Indian company) and the Screening Tools for Autism Risk using Technology (START; https://startproject.bhismalab.org/) funded through an MRC-GCRF Foundation Award. Our pilots allowed us to:1)refine the theoretical framework on which these tools were based,2)design them through iterative testing with young children with the incorporation of feedback from pilot studies, and3)systematically demonstrate evidence of their acceptability to pre-school end-users, feasibility for delivery by frontline workers, and validity against gold-standard developmental assessments thereby moving us forward in the innovation cycle from ideation to proof-of-concept. We have demonstrated that our innovative tools allow us to take gamified assessments of child developmental capabilities into the hands of frontline workers and assess young children in the comfort of their own home while they interact with evidence-based engaging assessments (Bhavnani et al., 2019Bhavnani S. Mukherjee D. Dasgupta J. Verma D. Parameshwaran D. Divan G. Sharma K.K. Thiagarajan T. Patel V. Development, feasibility and acceptability of a gamified cognitive DEvelopmental assessment on an E-Platform (DEEP) in rural Indian pre-schoolers \\u2013 a pilot study.Glob. Health Action. 2019; 12https://doi.org/10.1080/16549716.2018.1548005Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We have also shown that these assessments fare well against the gold standards of child development assessments (Mukherjee et al., 2020Mukherjee D. Bhavnani S. Swaminathan A. Verma D. Parameshwaran D. Divan G. Dasgupta J. Sharma K. Thiagarajan T.C. Patel V. Proof of concept of a gamified DEvelopmental Assessment on an E-Platform (DEEP) tool to measure cognitive development in rural indian preschool children.Front. Psychol. 2020; 11: 1202https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01202Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Our efforts have led to the creative integration of diverse assessment technologies, for example, designing the lead character of the DEEP games to be a child who wears a special cap has facilitated the child being assessed to agreeing to wear a portable EEG cap, thus allowing us to collect both the digital game data and EEG data simultaneously. As we published our encouraging results and disseminated them through conferences and workshops, we noted a growing interest in our tools. Two recent grants that have been awarded to our network (STREAM, funded by the MRC-GCRF grant [https://research.reading.ac.uk/stream/], and COINCIDE, funded by the Wellcome-DBT India Alliance Team Science Grant; https://www.indiaalliance.org/news/tsg-crc-awardees) will allow us to expand and strengthen our work. Our success in garnering funding is also representative of the ongoing shift in funding priorities of global health to promote cross disciplinary research. In part, this is fueled also by the recognition that the massive inequity in science funding and research in brain science at the global level (>90% is spent researching less than 10% of the world's population) is a fundamental barrier to catalyzing discoveries that can transform our understanding of complex developmental and mental health conditions (Saxena et al., 2006Saxena S. Paraje G. Sharan P. Karam G. Sadana R. The 10/90 divide in mental health research: trends over a 10-year period.Br. J. Psychiatry. 2006; 188: 81-82https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.bp.105.011221Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Three fundamental principles underlie the success of our collaboration. First, the co-creation with our community partners and target audience through active engagement of these groups as our tools are being designed. Second, a focus on building capacity of early career researchers to equip a new generation of academics with skills that cut across the silos of disciplines to galvanize this convergent approach to research. We have encouraged senior faculty from diverse disciplines to mentor the early career researchers and encourage all team members to participate in capacity building opportunities outside their specific discipline, for example, by sharing research articles to the entire team and attending seminars and conferences that were cross-disciplinary. Third, constantly broadening our horizons by learning about and exploring new opportunities to collaborate with other research groups who share our vision to give children the best start in life. Looking ahead, we hope to continue to leverage new resources and partnerships to realize our ultimate goal of scalable, valid assessments of early child development. One approach is to expand the testing of the existing tools (DEEP and START) to larger and more diverse populations with the expectation that this would improve the precision and generalizability of our machine learning models. Relatedly, we hope to make these tools accessible online so that parents can assess their own children using evidence-based tools and help us generate much larger volumes of data. A second approach, motivated by the success of our efforts, is exploring the potential of other non-invasive technologies that might be amenable to scale in community settings. Above all, we will continue to be guided by the key lesson of our experience so far, that addressing complex challenges facing humanity requires catalyzing the translational pathway from fundamental science to population impact by converging diverse disciplinary perspectives.\", \"url\": \"https://openalex.org/W3158614866\"}, {\"x\": -1.3449490070343018, \"y\": 2.0051493644714355, \"source\": \"openalex\", \"cluster\": 2, \"cluster_name\": \"Intelligent baby care\", \"cluster_description\": \"This cluster captures innovations in intelligent baby care devices, utilizing artificial intelligence for real-time monitoring, analysis, and communication with caregivers.

Daycare is a child-care alternative that permits guardians to drop off their kids during the day for care, management, and learning. Significantly, kids who participate in early child-care programs will be more beneficial and more fruitful in school. Child-care educators can share assets, thoughts and even get together in a nearby play area. Each parent has an alternate thought of what they need for their kids. There are various sorts of child-care offerings, Private child-care chains: An organization normally runs these as establishments, Private or independent nurseries: These are controlled by people or a group of people, home-based child-care: In India, this is a typical type of child-care, most of the time run by homemakers, Daycares connected to schools: Certain schools may decide to set up child-care appended to their school, Workplace childcares: Companies now and again have nearby child-care for youngsters. Several companies offer onsite child care support for their employees. Few organizations are Google, Johnson and Johnson, Boeing, Nike, Procter, Gamble, etc. Parents have the main concern that they want to know how their child is doing while they are away.

Abstract The application of machine learning (ML) to address population health challenges has received much less attention than its application in the clinical setting. One such challenge is addressing disparities in early childhood cognitive development\\u2014a complex public health issue rooted in the social determinants of health, exacerbated by inequity, characterised by intergenerational transmission, and which will continue unabated without novel approaches to address it. Early life, the period of optimal neuroplasticity, presents a window of opportunity for early intervention to improve cognitive development. Unfortunately for many, this window will be missed, and intervention may never occur or occur only when overt signs of cognitive delay manifest. In this review, we explore the potential value of ML and big data analysis in the early identification of children at risk for poor cognitive outcome, an area where there is an apparent dearth of research. We compare and contrast traditional statistical methods with ML approaches, provide examples of how ML has been used to date in the field of neurodevelopmental disorders, and present a discussion of the opportunities and risks associated with its use at a population level. The review concludes by highlighting potential directions for future research in this area. Impact To date, the application of machine learning to address population health challenges in paediatrics lags behind other clinical applications. This review provides an overview of the public health challenge we face in addressing disparities in childhood cognitive development and focuses on the cornerstone of early intervention.

Abstract Background Children's motor development is a crucial tool for assessing developmental levels, identifying developmental disorders early, and taking appropriate action. Although the Korean Developmental Screening Test for Infants and Children (K-DST) can accurately assess childhood development, its dependence on parental surveys rather than reliable, professional observation limits it. This study constructed a dataset based on a skeleton of recordings of K-DST behaviors in children aged between 20 and 71 months, with and without developmental disorders. The dataset was validated using a child behavior artificial intelligence (AI) learning model to highlight its possibilities. Results The 339 participating children were divided into 3 groups by age. We collected videos of 4 behaviors by age group from 3 different angles and extracted skeletons from them. The raw data were used to annotate labels for each image, denoting whether each child performed the behavior properly. Behaviors were selected from the K-DST's gross motor section. The number of images collected differed by age group. The original dataset underwent additional processing to improve its quality. Finally, we confirmed that our dataset can be used in the AI model with 93.94%, 87.50%, and 96.31% test accuracy for the 3 age groups in an action recognition model. Additionally, the models trained with data including multiple views showed the best performance. Conclusion Ours is the first publicly available dataset that constitutes skeleton-based action recognition in young children according to the standardized criteria (K-DST). This dataset will enable the development of various models for developmental tests and screenings.\", \"url\": \"https://openalex.org/W4378576056\"}, {\"x\": 1.3287405967712402, \"y\": -0.686437726020813, \"source\": \"openalex\", \"cluster\": 1, \"cluster_name\": \"AI in education\", \"cluster_description\": \"This cluster of documents focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in early childhood education, exploring how AI can enhance learning experiences and develop children's skills.

Human services systems make key decisions that impact individuals in the society. The U.S. child welfare system makes such decisions, from screening-in hotline reports of suspected abuse or neglect for child protective investigations, placing children in foster care, to returning children to permanent home settings. These complex and impactful decisions on children's lives rely on the judgment of child welfare decisionmakers. Child welfare agencies have been exploring ways to support these decisions with empirical, data-informed methods that include machine learning (ML). This paper describes a conceptual framework for ML to support child welfare decisions. The ML framework guides how child welfare agencies might conceptualize a target problem that ML can solve; vet available administrative data for building ML; formulate and develop ML specifications that mirror relevant populations and interventions the agencies are undertaking; deploy, evaluate, and monitor ML as child welfare context, policy, and practice change over time. Ethical considerations, stakeholder engagement, and avoidance of common pitfalls underpin the framework's impact and success. From abstract to concrete, we describe one application of this framework to support a child welfare decision.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition made up of enduring challenges in social communication and interaction and the presence of repetitive and restricted behavior patterns. Early diagnosis of autism is crucial for timely intervention and improved long-term outcomes. This review aims to explore some of its signs and symptoms, look into some diagnostic tools, and analyze the benefits and risks associated with an early diagnosis of autism. The symptoms of ASD vary from child to child, some of which are: avoidance of eye contact, lack of response to names, excessive fear, and lack of interactive and pretend play. Early identification of these symptoms by caregivers and healthcare providers facilitates the need for diagnosis and appropriate interventions. Some screening and diagnostic tools that have been found to help make the diagnosis are the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up (M-CHAT-R/F), the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), the Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS), and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), amongst others. The benefits of early diagnosis include the opportunity for early intervention, which has been shown to enhance developmental outcomes and improve adaptive skills. Early identification allows for the implementation of specialized interventions tailored to the specific needs of individuals with autism, targeting social communication, language development, and behavioral challenges. Furthermore, early diagnosis enables families to access appropriate support services, educational resources, and community programs, facilitating better coping mechanisms, reducing parental stress, and increasing adult independence. However, early diagnosis of autism also entails certain risks. One significant concern is the potential for labeling and stigmatization, which can impact the child's self-esteem and social interactions. There is a risk of overdiagnosis or misdiagnosis, leading to unnecessary interventions and treatments. Additionally, the diagnostic process can be lengthy, complex, and emotionally challenging for families, requiring comprehensive assessments by multidisciplinary teams. This review highlights the importance of a balanced approach when considering the benefits and risks of early diagnosis. Early identification allows for timely interventions that significantly improve developmental outcomes and quality of life for individuals with autism. To mitigate the risks, it is crucial to ensure accurate and reliable diagnostic procedures, support families throughout the process, and promote societal awareness and acceptance. We also highlighted some future directions in the management of autism, including the use of biomarkers and the use of artificial intelligence and learning for diagnosing ASD.\", \"url\": \"https://openalex.org/W4385690366\"}, {\"x\": 1.7795732021331787, \"y\": 1.7377759218215942, \"source\": \"openalex\", \"cluster\": 3, \"cluster_name\": \"Machine learning for child development\", \"cluster_description\": \"This cluster captures innovations in using machine learning and predictive models to assess and predict various aspects of infant and child development, including health, cognitive outcomes, language development, and risk factors for conditions like asthma and obesity.

Early identification of vulnerable children to protect them from harm and support them in achieving their long-term potential is a community priority. This is particularly important in the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia, where Aboriginal children are about 40% of all children, and for whom the trauma and disadvantage experienced by Aboriginal Australians has ongoing intergenerational impacts. Given that shared social determinants influence child outcomes across the domains of health, education and welfare, there is growing interest in collaborative interventions that simultaneously respond to outcomes in all domains. There is increasing recognition that many children receive services from multiple NT government agencies, however there is limited understanding of the pattern and scale of overlap of these services. In this paper, NT health, education, child protection and perinatal datasets have been linked for the first time. The records of 8,267 children born in the NT in 2006-2009 were analysed using a person-centred analytic approach. Unsupervised machine learning techniques were used to discover clusters of NT children who experience different patterns of risk. Modelling revealed four or five distinct clusters including a cluster of children who are predominantly ill and experience some neglect, a cluster who predominantly experience abuse and a cluster who predominantly experience neglect. These three, high risk clusters all have low school attendance and together comprise 10-15% of the population. There is a large group of thriving children, with low health needs, high school attendance and low CPS contact. Finally, an unexpected cluster is a modestly sized group of non-attendees, mostly Aboriginal children, who have low school attendance but are otherwise thriving. The high risk groups experience vulnerability in all three domains of health, education and child protection, supporting the need for a flexible, rather than strictly differentiated response. Interagency cooperation would be valuable to provide a suitably collective and coordinated response for the most vulnerable children.\", \"url\": \"https://openalex.org/W4317437893\"}, {\"x\": 2.7849161624908447, \"y\": 2.5094995498657227, \"source\": \"openalex\", \"cluster\": 3, \"cluster_name\": \"Machine learning for child development\", \"cluster_description\": \"This cluster captures innovations in using machine learning and predictive models to assess and predict various aspects of infant and child development, including health, cognitive outcomes, language development, and risk factors for conditions like asthma and obesity.

ABSTRACTSocial robots are designed to interact with humans and this technology is entering early childhood classrooms across the world. Research is needed to understand teachers' perspectives on the benefits and barriers of using social robots with children. In this study, 94 teachers working in preschool or the early years of primary school, in Australia, completed a survey that asked teachers about their perspectives on using social robots in the classroom. Teachers reported that the main benefits of social robots would be to improve young children's learning and engagement and barriers included financial cost, limited teacher training, and technical support for using social robots in the classroom. Overall, teachers were generally neutral in their views about social robots, neither dismissing nor embracing them. It is recommended that early childhood teachers be provided with greater opportunities and training to experience these new digital technologies for supporting children's learning in the classroom.KEYWORDS: Social robotsteachersperspectivesyoung childrenlearningclassroom Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.Additional informationNotes on contributorsMichelle M.

To date, there is a lack of survey articles that discuss the studies of AI in ECE. In this paper, we provide an up-to-date and in-depth overview of the key AI technologies in ECE that provides a historical perspective, summarizes the representative works, outlines open questions, discusses the trends and challenges through a detailed bibliometric analysis, and provides insightful recommendations for future research. We mainly discuss the studies that apply AI-based robots and AI technologies to ECE, including improving the social interaction of children with an autism spectrum disorder.

The aim of the current study was to predict the development of EC at 36 months of age from early attentional and environmental measures taken in infancy using a machine learning approach. A sample of 75 infants participated in a longitudinal study running different waves of data collection at 6, 9 and 36 months of age.

We are preoccupied with early childhood education policies at the international level in general, but in particular with early childhood education in Romania. Therefore, the research direction of our study focuses on how early education teachers can integrate the principles of slow education into the development of child-centered competence. The formation and development of the child\\u2019s early ontogeny personality occur at the natural pace of development and learning rather than in an accelerated manner. While preparing for the research, we reviewed relevant articles circumscribed to the same topic: slow, child-centered education, deep learning, constructivism, and the enthusiasm of children and teachers. Most of them conclude that the use of child-centered competence in early childhood significantly contributes to slow education principles and characteristics. At the same time, the research aims to provide quantitatively and qualitatively validated arguments for verifying the incidence of child-centered competence from the perspective of sustainable education, in connection with the constructivist orientation of the teachers. Our research included a group of 376 teachers selected from early childhood education institutions in the North-West of Romania, all of them with initial preparation in the field. Using the focus group method, we identified differences in the perception of the two paradigms (child-centeredness and slow pedagogy), the link between these two, and the connection with the constructivist orientation. At the same time, we intended to identify the degree of continuous professional development training according to these paradigms that are not studied and practiced together in early education in Romania, because only the child-centeredness principle is mentioned in the initial teacher training. Therefore, in-service training activities were conducted and they were focused on facilitating and raising awareness of the value of using child-centered competence and the principles of slow education among training participants. At the end of the program, through the quantitative method\\u2014the survey\\u2014we concluded that the activities included in the training program led to a significant increase in the teachers\\u2019 capacity to appreciate the natural pace of development and learning of children to such an extent that the participants themselves adopted the promotion of sustainable slow education in a dynamic society. The methods used helped us deduce that all teachers with a constructivist orientation improved their child-centered competence, and teachers who gave children the freedom to choose activities from the proposed educational offers, according to their needs, interests, and potential, identified the development of the ability to consider children\\u2019s natural pace of development and learning as a result of the training. In conclusion, our research complements the literature, proposing a new and useful perspective to approach early childhood education practices by respecting the child\\u2019s natural pace of development and learning, which provides a suitable context for promoting international sustainable educational policies.

Background: Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) has been associated with an increased risk of allergic rhinitis in children. However, it is unclear whether food allergy modifies the association between PM exposure and childhood allergic rhinitis. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the modification of food allergy on the association between PM exposure and allergic rhinitis in preschool children. Methods: We adopted a cross-sectional study and conducted a questionnaire survey among preschool children aged 3 to 6 years in 7 cities in China from June 2019 to June 2020 to collect information on allergic rhinitis. A mature machine learning-based space-time extremely randomized trees model was applied to estimate early-life, prenatal, and first-year exposure of PM , PM and PM at 1 \\u00d7 1-km resolution. We used a combination of multilevel logistic regression and restricted cubic spline functions to quantitatively assess whether food allergy modifies the associations between size-specific PM exposure and the risk of childhood allergic rhinitis. Results: The adjusted ORs for childhood allergic rhinitis among the children with food allergy as per interquartile range (IQR) increase in early-life PM , PM and PM were significantly higher than the corresponding ORs among the children without food allergy [e.g. OR: 1.57, 95% CI (1.32, 1.87) vs. 1.29, 95% CI (1.18, 1.41), for per IQR increase in PM (9.8 \\u03bcg/m )]. The similar patterns were observed for both prenatal and first-year size-specific PM exposure. The interactions between food allergy and size-specific PM exposure on childhood allergic rhinitis were statistically significant (all p - &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Food allergy, as an important part of the allergic disease progression, may modify the association between ambient PM exposure and the risk of childhood allergic rhinitis.

First, as a result of confirming kindergarten parents' perception of artificial intelligence, parents' thoughts on artificial intelligence were positive, interest was moderate, and experience was high. In the case of education using artificial intelligence in kindergartens, the use of touch screens, coding, and learning devices and the need for artificial intelligence education in kindergartens were high. Second, as a result of analyzing parents' perceptions of early childhood artificial intelligence education according to parent variables, there was no difference in other variables, but there was a significant difference in parents' gender and age. Specifically, the father was more aware of the need for artificial intelligence education than the mother, and parents in their 40s and 50s were more aware of the need for artificial intelligence education in the kindergarten regular curriculum than parents in their 20s and 30s.

Machine learning-based space-time models were utilized to estimate early-life residential exposure to PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 at 1 \\u00d7 1-km resolutions. The concentrations of PM1\\u20132.5 and PM2.5\\u201310 were calculated by subtracting PM1 from PM2.5 and PM2.5 from PM10, respectively. Multiple mixed-effects logistic models were used to assess the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of childhood AR associated with per 10-\\u03bcg/m3 increase in exposure to particulate air pollution during in utero period and the first year of life. Among the 29,286 children surveyed (mean \\u00b1 standard deviation, 4.9 \\u00b1 0.9 years), 3652 (12.5%) were reported to be diagnosed with AR.

Exposure to PM1 and PM2.5 during pregnancy and the first year of life was associated with an increased risk of AR in children, and the OR estimates were higher for each 10-\\u03bcg/m3 increase in PM1 than for PM2.5 (e.g., 1.132 [95% CI: 1.022\\u20131.254] vs. 1.079 [95% CI:1.014\\u20131.149] in pregnancy; 1.151 [95% CI: 1.014\\u20131.306] vs. 1.095 [95% CI: 1.008\\u20131.189] in the first year of life). No associations were observed between AR and both pre- and post-natal exposure to PM1\\u20132.5, indicating that PM1 rather than PM1\\u20132.5 contributed to the association between PM2.5 and childhood AR. In trimester-stratified analysis, childhood AR was only found to be associated with exposure to PM1 (OR = 1.077, 95% CI: 1.027\\u20131.128), PM2.5 (OR = 1.048, 95% CI: 1.018\\u20131.078), and PM10 (OR = 1.032, 95% CI: 1.007\\u20131.058) during the third trimester of pregnancy.

This study aims to disentangle the relative timing and importance of early markers of asthma. Methods Using the CHILD Cohort Study, 132 variables measured in 1754 multi-ethnic children were included in the analysis for asthma prediction. Data up to 4 years of age was used in multiple machine learning models to predict physician-diagnosed asthma at age 5 years. Both predictive performance and variable importance was assessed in these models. Results Early-life data (\\u22641 year) has limited predictive ability for physician-diagnosed asthma at age 5 years (area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) &lt; 0.35). The earliest reliable prediction of asthma is achieved at age 3 years, (area under the receiver-operator curve (AUROC) &gt; 0.90) and (AUPRC &gt; 0.80). Maternal asthma, antibiotic exposure, and lower respiratory tract infections remained highly predictive throughout childhood. Wheezing status and atopy are the most important predictors of early childhood asthma from among the factors included in this study. Conclusions Childhood asthma is predictable from non-biological measurements from the age of 3 years, primarily using parental asthma and patient history of wheezing, atopy, antibiotic exposure, and lower respiratory tract infections.

Behavioral studies over more than two decades have shown that young infants have a rich understanding of the physics of the world, with general expectations about the dynamics of objects and substances.

Recent computational models can capture aspects of physical scene understanding by performing probabilistic inferences over representations similar to those used in video game physics engines, which enable players to interact realistically with objects in virtual physical scenes. Game engines rely on numerous shortcuts and hacks to efficiently simulate approximations to Newtonian mechanics for complex scenes in real-time. Mental physics engines, solving a similar problem, may have converged on similar approximations and concepts. Physics-engine representations can help to explain the patterns of success and failure in the intuitive physics of infants, as well as illusions and misperceptions in adults.

Deep neural networks are increasingly being used in both supervised learning for classification tasks and unsupervised learning to derive complex patterns from the input data. However, the successful implementation of deep neural networks using neuroimaging datasets requires adequate sample size for training and well-defined signal intensity based structural differentiation. There is a lack of effective automated diagnostic tools for the reliable detection of brain dysmaturation in the neonatal period, related to small sample size and complex undifferentiated brain structures, despite both translational research and clinical importance. Volumetric information alone is insufficient for diagnosis. In this study, we developed a computational framework for the automated classification of brain dysmaturation from neonatal MRI, by combining a specific deep neural network implementation with neonatal structural brain segmentation as a method for both clinical pattern recognition and data-driven inference into the underlying structural morphology. We implemented three-dimensional convolution neural networks (3D-CNNs) to specifically classify dysplastic cerebelli, a subset of surface-based subcortical brain dysmaturation, in term infants born with congenital heart disease. We obtained a 0.985 \\u00b1 0. 0241-classification accuracy of subtle cerebellar dysplasia in CHD using 10-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, the hidden layer activations and class activation maps depicted regional vulnerability of the superior surface of the cerebellum, (composed of mostly the posterior lobe and the midline vermis), in regards to differentiating the dysplastic process from normal tissue. The posterior lobe and the midline vermis provide regional differentiation that is relevant to not only to the clinical diagnosis of cerebellar dysplasia, but also genetic mechanisms and neurodevelopmental outcome correlates. These findings not only contribute to the detection and classification of a subset of neonatal brain dysmaturation, but also provide insight to the pathogenesis of cerebellar dysplasia in CHD. In addition, this is one of the first examples of the application of deep learning to a neuroimaging dataset, in which the hidden layer activation revealed diagnostically and biologically relevant features about the clinical pathogenesis.

Over three decades ago, Arnold Relman, the then Editor of the N Engl J Med, predicted a \\u2018third revolution in medical care\\u2019.1 Relman's thesis was that a focus on the quality of services and cost control would lead to dramatic improvements in health care. Such \\u2018assessment and accountability\\u2019 would be made possible by \\u2018linking medical management decisions to new, systematic information about outcomes of treatment\\u2019 using computerised health information systems.1 Although Relman's prediction has not come to pass, digital information systems that capture vast amounts of medical and related data are now on the verge of revolutionising the work of perinatal and other epidemiologists. This issue of Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology includes two articles that highlight recent developments in health information systems: Su\\u00e1rez-Idueta et al.2 present the results of linking live birth and death registration data (for infants and children <5 years of age) in Mexico, while Johansson et al.3 discuss avant-garde population-based database linkages that bring together detailed clinical and related information on pregnant women in the Stockholm-Gotland cohort. The linkage of 24 million live births to deaths in infancy and early childhood represents a significant epidemiologic success for Mexico, despite challenges related to the underestimation of deaths, and unlinked deaths.2 A similar attempt in Canada in the 1990s resulted in a 25% rate of unlinked infant deaths in Ontario, the largest province in Canada.4 Several investigations aimed at identifying the cause for the missing birth registrations in the vital statistics data proved unsuccessful, and ultimately led to a completely revamped perinatal program in Ontario, and live birth-infant death linkages using an alternative hospitalisation database.5 The previous development and recent consolidation of detailed database linkages in the Stockholm-Gotland cohort are highly inspirational even against the Swedish backdrop, where longstanding deterministic linkages between databases (based on unique personal identifiers) have already yielded numerous epidemiologic insights. The availability of longitudinal clinical, laboratory and other information on the mother, fetus and infant will provide boundless opportunities for groundbreaking epidemiologic research. The explosion in detailed health information within databases and through database linkages has led to many different disciplines entering a field that has been, until recently, the almost exclusive prerogative of epidemiologists. Undoubtedly, the involvement of students of health informatics and data science (among others) in health research will facilitate and enrich medical research. The increasing use of machine learning techniques, and artificial intelligence, more generally, will provide a substantial impetus to diagnostic and non-causal prognostic research both by epidemiologists and other professionals. The benefits of an influx of new researchers into the health research arena notwithstanding, inter-disciplinary semantic and methodologic differences could pose communication and other challenges. As members of the discipline traditionally involved with analysing and interpreting health data using non-experimental designs, epidemiologists have a duty to help manage this expansion in professional diversity. At the very least, epidemiologists have an obligation to introduce newcomers to the lessons learned and caveats derived from decades of working with non-experimental data. One crucial general lesson is the importance of integrating substantive (clinical) understanding and methodologic principles, while arguably the most outstanding particular caveat is the problem of confounding by indication. This latter phenomenon haunts non-experimental studies of therapeutic efficacy when the outcome of interest is an intended effect.6, 7 It is generally accepted that the efficacy of therapy, whether drug, surgery, or other intervention, is best assessed through randomised trials because confounding by indication in non-experimental studies is generally considered intractable. Higher maternal mortality rates following caesarean delivery (as compared with vaginal delivery) epitomise this issue. The Sixth Report of the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health in the United Kingdom8 highlighted this problem of confounding by indication by stating that \\u2018it is almost impossible to disentangle the consequences of a caesarean section from the indication for the operation\\u2019. The bias of confounding by indication is also evident in the crude positive associations between admission to intensive care units (compared with admission to general wards) and death; between people with hypertension on medication (compared with normotensive people and even those with hypertension not on medication) and stroke and between hospital births (compared with home births) and perinatal death.6, 7 One of the more exciting developments associated with databases and linked database research is the ability to examine clinically and socially relevant determinants and outcomes that may be otherwise difficult to study. Rare outcomes and outcomes that require short- or long-term follow-up can be more easily studied by accessing large population databases or by linking different databases. Successive pregnancy and sibling studies are a particular genre of perinatal research that exemplify the utility of such database linkages.9, 10 The population-based nature of some databases can address problems that may arise due to more selective inclusion into a study population, and the large study sizes, which typify many such databases, are also a clear benefit. Access to information on a given determinant, confounder or outcome that may be more accurate or complete is another potential advantage of linked database research. Figure 1A shows how linking the birth database to subsequent hospitalisation and outpatient-visit databases in Sweden provides a more complete picture of congenital malformations. Figure 1B shows the frequency of cyanotic congenital heart disease infant deaths in the United States, with more deaths of infants whose heart defect was not diagnosed at birth compared with the death of infants whose heart defect was diagnosed at birth. These figures provide a sense of the misclassification that occurs in studies, which rely solely on birth data for ascertaining congenital anomaly status. The general problem of misclassification of determinant and/or outcome status is not unique to research using databases and is well understood. Studies using the information on congenital anomalies at birth and the study by Su\\u00e1rez-Idueta et al.2 will yield reasonable and useful estimates of association if misclassification of determinant/outcome status is non-differential (with estimates biased towards the null). On the other hand, the need to obtain accurate quantitative information on confounders represents a more crucial requirement as the distortion in effect estimates given residual confounding is less predictable (see below). Attempts at including data such as those on socioeconomic, environmental and behavioural factors in the Stockholm-Gotland cohort are therefore a prudent step, and database managers elsewhere would be wise to follow suit. Large databases tend to include some transcription and other related errors, and implausible values for all relevant data elements need to be addressed at the outset. Additionally, the idiosyncrasies of specific databases need to be understood if the results are to be interpreted correctly. Figure 2 presents the frequency distribution of birthweights obtained from birth databases in Sweden and the United States and shows end-digit preference in Sweden and end-digit and ounce preference in the United States. Although the phenomena illustrated in this example are trivial and will not impact the results of most studies, an awareness of such issues is required for the occasional situation when such quirks can lead to problems. One potential problem with database research arises in connection with attempts to answer causal questions non-experimentally. Whereas research has traditionally required pre-specification of the object of study and ad hoc collection of data on the determinant, confounders and outcome status, database studies use data collected for a purpose not directly related to the object of any particular research study. Thus, databases may contain accurate information on the determinant and outcome, and only include poor quality or absent information on key confounders. Unlike non-differential misclassification of determinant/ outcome status, which typically has predictable consequences, misclassification of confounder status poses a greater threat to validity. Although recent developments in the area of quantitative bias analysis permit an assessment of threats to validity due to unaddressed confounding, it is debatable whether researchers should attempt to answer causal questions when the database does not contain accurate information on key confounders. Two other inter-related issues involving database research require mentioning, namely, ethics/confidentiality and data access. Ethics and confidentiality issues, while extremely important, are currently managed variably, with some countries and institutions allowing free access to anonymized data repositories, others providing more restricted access, and the scientific community increasingly advocating for data sharing along with publication. Data access issues have to be resolved by balancing the public good that could follow increased access with the risk of confidentiality being breached because of unconstrained access. Databases and linked databases (which are literally matrices, hence the title) are ushering in an era where epidemiologists and other professionals will be required to work with vast quantities of detailed clinical and related health data. Although many routine, big data analysis tasks will likely be automated in the future, the automated algorithms and new studies will require a multi-disciplinary integration of substantive and methodologic inputs. The adage that \\u2018knowledge is power\\u2019 requires data to be first processed into information and information to be distilled into knowledge.

Abstract Background Emotional behavior problems (EBP) are the most common and persistent mental health issues in early childhood. Early intervention programs are crucial in helping children with EBP. Parent\\u2013child interaction therapy (PCIT) is an evidence-based therapy designed to address personal difficulties of parent\\u2013child dyads as well as reduce externalizing behaviors. In clinical practice, parents consistently struggle to provide accurate characterizations of EBP symptoms (number, timing of tantrums, precipitating events) even from the week before in their young children. The main aim of the study is to evaluate feasibility of the use of smartwatches in children aged 3\\u20137 years with EBP. Methods This randomized double-blind controlled study aims to recruit a total of 100 participants, consisting of 50 children aged 3\\u20137 years with an EBP measure rated above the clinically significant range (T-score \\u2265 60) (Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory-ECBI; Eyberg &amp; Pincus, 1999) and their parents who are at least 18 years old. Participants are randomly assigned to the artificial intelligence-PCIT group (AI-PCIT) or the PCIT-sham biometric group. Outcome parameters include weekly ECBI and Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) as well as Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) obtained weeks 1, 6, and 12 of the study. Two smartphone applications (Garmin connect and mEMA) and a wearable Garmin smartwatch are used collect the data to monitor step count, sleep, heart rate, and activity intensity. In the AI-PCIT group, the mEMA application will allow for the ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and will send behavioral alerts to the parent. Discussion Real-time predictive technologies to engage patients rely on daily commitment on behalf of the participant and recurrent frequent smartphone notifications. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) provides a way to digitally phenotype in-the-moment behavior and functioning of the parent\\u2013child dyad. One of the study\\u2019s goals is to determine if AI-PCIT outcomes are superior in comparison with standard PCIT. Overall, we believe that the PISTACHIo study will also be able to determine tolerability of smartwatches in children aged 3\\u20137 with EBP and could participate in a fundamental shift from the traditional way of assessing and treating EBP to a more individualized treatment plan based on real-time information about the child\\u2019s behavior.

Abstract Previous research showed that the parents acknowledged the technology's benefits for their young children's learning, however, they are still worried about the extended screen time, lack of physical activity and lack of social interactions. To address these concerns, we developed Kid Space to enable pedagogically appropriate technology use for children in early childhood education by combining various sensing technologies with a multi\\u2010modal conversational artificial intelligence system that can interact with children, understand individual progress and provide personalised learning experiences. To understand the impact of Kid Space on the parents' initial concerns about technology use by their young children, we conducted a multi\\u2010method user study: (1) a quasi\\u2010experimental design and (2) formative research method using an exploratory case study with a set of children and their parents experiencing Kid Space in their homes. The results show that after experiencing Kid Space with their children, the parents felt significantly less concerned about screen time, social interactions and physical activity and reported positive perceptions towards pedagogical value of Kid Space. Detailed analysis on the multi\\u2010modal data quantitatively and qualitatively validated why Kid Space alleviated these concerns. Future research is needed to validate long\\u2010term educational value of Kid Space and generate insights for improvement for next iterations. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Play\\u2010based learning is critical for young children's education, but digital games create major concerns around extended screen time, lack of physical activity and lack of social interactions. Blending digital and physical spaces could support pedagogically appropriate technology use for young children.

However, none of these studies supported children's most natural mode of communication in their interactions with the systems\\u2014speaking. Pedagogical conversational agents (PCAs) are promising, but they are tricky when it comes to young children's speech because of unique technical challenges resulted from how children use language and communicate with digital systems.

To add to this blackness, thunderous rains rattle the windows. Sensing an opportunity, with a mischievous smile, the grandmother lights a candle. Children huddle around her and the candle flame, knowing that she would, any moment now, burst into a spine-chilling story of haunted houses, ghosts, and the like. But a toddler watches all this, from a distance, fascinated by the fire. The dancing flames of the candle have kindled his curiosity. His face lights up, not just with wonder, but also by the glow from the flame. He cruises around the furniture and squeezing himself silently between the children, he reaches a finger to touch the dancing gold-dust of the candle flame. A cry of pain pierces the night. Children and the grandmother rush to comfort the toddler. As he disappears into the all-encompassing comfort of a grandmotherly hug, he swears never to go near a flame again. The toddler observes the flame, explores it with his finger, understands the pain of the burn caused by the flame, and finally, learns to avoid the fire.

What is artificial intelligence or AI? Simply put, it is the ability of a computer program to think and learn like humans. It is also the field of study that tries to make computers smart, says Wikipedia.[1] The underlying assumption, of course, is that humans are \\u201csmart\\u201d! Coming back to the analogy of the toddler and the flame, replace the toddler with a smartphone app and the candle flame with the diabetic retina. Just like the toddler observes the flame, the software observes the retina. Just like the toddler explores the flame, the smartphone explores the retina and photographs it. Like the toddler understands the pain of the flame, the smartphone understands the damage wreaked by diabetic retinopathy. And, just like the toddler has learnt to avoid the flame, the smartphone app learns to avoid blindness, by timely referral to the ophthalmologist. Simply put, the smartphone app is displaying AI. The analogy isn't perfect, but probably manages to simplify AI for the clinical endocrinologists like me, for whom this article is written. Diabetic retinopathy diagnosis and referral are one of the most prominent applications of AI in diabetes. In a recent publication from Western India, using a smartphone-based AI algorithm to diagnose \\u201creferable retinopathy\\u201d had 100% sensitivity and 88% specificity.[2] Notably, this study was done in the community setting with a small sample size (n = 213), but using a smartphone-based AI algorithm that had the AI software available offline, meaning that it would also work in remote areas where internet penetration was suboptimal. Recently, the US FDA has, for the first time, approved the use of a smartphone-based AI algorithm for retinopathy diagnosis.[3] This idea of artificial intelligence in health care is not new. IBM's Watson, the well-known question answer computing system, is already being utilized to assist in decision making for complex clinical situations. A recent publication looked at the concordance of Watson-directed cancer care decisions vs oncologist-directed ones.[4] The results showed that different cancer types showed different concordances, as far as decision making was concerned. Clearly, this evolving field has a lot of scope for more research. THE FAST LEARNER Humans possess the ability to learn from their past experiences. Machines are designed to follow instructions given by humans. But wouldn't it be great if humans can train machines to learn from their past observations? Then, machines would be able to do the tasks humans can, but in a much faster and better manner. This is called \\u201cmachine learning,\\u201d another aspect of AI.[5] Imagine millions of glucose sensors (from millions of people with diabetes) inputting data into an algorithm, which is also loaded with medication dosages and clinical information on a prospective, continuous basis. The AI software \\u201clearns\\u201d the data and determines the optimal medication, say insulin, and recommends the dosage. This would be an example of machine learning. A simpler version of this is already happening. Let us take the example of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, which generate huge amounts of blood glucose measurements. Newer CGMs are also able to display the glucose levels real time, on a smartphone or reader.[6] Let us say that Ms. Y who has type 1 diabetes and is on a CGM system, finds that her current blood glucose reading is 183 mg/dl. By itself, the inference of this point measurement would just be that her current blood glucose level is high. However, what if the blood glucose reading just an hour ago had been 73 mg/dl? This would mean that the momentum of rise of blood glucose may carry the glucose levels into the hyperglycemic ranges. Predicting this, the CGM display screen shows an upward pointing arrow cautioning Ms. Y about the imminent hyperglycemia. Similarly, if the current blood glucose is 183 mg/dl, and the blood glucose an hour ago 592 mg/dl, then a downward-pointed arrow would warn Ms. Y about imminent hypoglycemia. In both these cases, humans have trained the machine to learn about not just hypo- and hyperglycemia, but also about predicting the rises and falls in glucose levels. AI can also be used to interpret large amounts of data so that the clinician can understand complexity in simpler terms. An example is the ambulatory glucose profile graph generated via flash glucose monitoring, which helps the doctor interpret intra- and inter-day glucose variability as well as high and low blood glucose levels in a somewhat simple graphical image.[7] COMPASSION FROM A CHATBOT Chatbots have been already employed for glycemia management.[8] A chatbot is a computer software that mimics a human voice, via both audio and text communication. Mimicking an output from the human brain, which has about a 100 billion neuronal connections, is no easy task. Naturally, this form of AI is referred to as neural network computing, a common terminology in the realm of AI. Another term that is common is deep learning, a form of AI that describes how neural networks handle large sets of data, typically of a multilayered type.[9] Currently, scientists are researching the use of a chatbot to understand and motivate people with diabetes.[10] A conversation between a chatbot with a person with diabetes (Mr. X) may proceed in this manner - Mr. X: \\u201cI feel very tired. Problems at home. Problems at work. Too tired to do anything. Feel Exhausted.\\u201d Chatbot: \\u201cI understand how you feel. Don't worry. Everything will turn out just fine. Remember, be active, because exercise will release endorphins into your brain to make you happier! And do remember to eat healthier meals today.\\u201d Note that here, there is an input from Mr. X and an output from the chatbot. But what happens in between? Does the chatbot really \\u201cunderstand\\u201d and empathize with Mr. X? No. The chatbot is simply processing sets of data and coming out with the most appropriate output. And what about Mr X? Would Mr X be consoled with the output from the chatbot once he knows fully well that the chatbot is only providing an \\u201coutput\\u201d without any genuine empathy? After all, a chatbot, at least at this point of time, may not have feelings! Such a conversation, as every endocrinologist would say, would remove the warmth and the human touch, an essential part of the doctor\\u2013patient relationship. However, chatbots are quick learners, and future research could work to endow chatbots with better empathy and to mimic the flaws in human nature, the qualities that make us more vulnerable, and more human. Japan has been using real robots for care in the elderly.[11] Preliminary research suggests that they may provide better care than the conventional methods, and exciting research is helping to endow robots with \\u201cartificial empathy\\u201d.[1112] THE SORTING HAT For those not yet initiated into the Harry Potter lore, the Sorting Hat is a hat worn by children, before they begin studies at the fictional Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[13] There are four houses in the school. When each child wears the Sorting Hat, the hat analyses the brain, and sometimes even has a short conversation before assigning a child into a particular house in the school. Given the complexity of this task, the hat has been called \\u201cmagical\\u201d. In a stunning parallel to the Sorting Hat, researchers have applied a similar sorting process for people with diabetes from Europe.[14] This sorting was based on six variables: glutamate decarboxylase antibodies, age at diagnosis, BMI, HbA 1c, and homoeostatic model assessment 2 estimates of \\u03b2-cell function and insulin resistance. Advanced \\u201csorting\\u201d was carried out with prospective data from patient records on development of complications and prescription of medication. The subjects were sorted into five clusters with differing disease progression and risk of diabetic complications.[14] While one cluster predicted kidney disease, another cluster was associated with severe insulin deficiency. This new sub-stratification represented a first step towards precision medicine in diabetes. The future could see the combination of such cluster data on phenotype, combined with genotype as well as behavioral/social-media-based data to generate specific clusters of diabetes requiring specific approaches with lifestyle as well as medications. This would include personalized nutrition or exercise advice as well. This would evolve with time, as personalized health care is becoming a buzzword for the future. Why are such clusters important? We know that not all people with an illness respond to a medication similarly. Let us assume that a hypothetical treatment Z works excellently only in 10% of people with a disease. As it did not work well in 90%, the treatment was not approved for all subjects with the disease. But if via AI we are able to discern the characteristics of the responders (who are 10%), could treatment Z be a personalized health care for this minority with the illness? This is the hope behind the integration of AI in personalizing medical care. THE RISE OF THE TYPE ONES It is well known that linking glucose sensor readings to insulin pump output perfectly could result in a true artificial pancreas. The algorithms and complexities of this task are so gargantuan that not even the most perfect sensor-augmented pumps can lay a claim to having solved the artificial pancreas. Moreover, these high-end pumps come at an exorbitant price. A more recent advance is the 'bionic pancreas\\u201d which utilizes a combination of insulin and glucagon delivery to more closely mimic the physiological glucose metabolism. However, even the bionic pancreas has had limited success so far.[15] All this has led to a form of AI-focused support group, among people with type 1 diabetes, as the title of this paragraph suggests. This group uses open source software to develop a true, closed loop artificial pancreas. This phenomenon, called \\u201cDo-it-yourself (DIY) Closed Looping\\u201d has many supporters around the world, including both people with type 1 diabetes and their relatives, and even clinical experts, who do not wish to wait for such technology to become formally approved.[16] The problems with these devices include security concerns, lack of an adverse event reporting mechanisms, lack of approvals by regulatory bodies, lack of published high-quality trials as well as doubtful reliability. Diabetes UK recently came out with a position statement saying that people on DIY Closed Loop should continue to receive support and care from their diabetes care team.[16] THE CASE AGAINST AI Not everyone is excited about AI. AI in health care is at a nascent stage and AI-generated reports could sometimes be erroneous. But there are other arguments against AI. Stephen Hawking, the renowned physicist, had famously warned humanity about computers taking over the world.[17] Yuval Noah Harari, the well-known historian, has also predicted that AI, coupled with overall scientific progress, could change humanity by creating three different kinds of \\u201csuper\\u201d human beings, who are better than Homo sapiens.[18] The first type of superhuman could be a genetically engineered human, chosen to have a perfect body and brain by cherry picking the best genes. The second type of superhuman would be a \\u201ccyborg\\u201d: or humans having both organic and inorganic parts. Bionic hands, feet, or even a bionic pancreas (as discussed earlier) could revolutionize the world of the future. The third type of superhuman who might evolve could be a completely inorganic person, not even requiring a human brain\\u2014but having a much more powerful inorganic brain with artificial intelligence. All this sounds a little too futuristic! Will these super humans ever come to be? However, the point is, if they ever make it to existence, how will they interact with lesser mortals like Homo sapiens (read: us)? Will they make us their workhorses or their pets? Will they exterminate us, just like we humans attempt to eradicate mosquitoes? AI experts often debate about the point of \\u201csingularity,\\u201d the time when artificial intelligence would overtake human intelligence.[19] If humanity stumbles at the point of singularity, then, some of these experts hypothesize that artificial intelligence could dominate the world, and the race of Homo sapiens as we know today could face extinction. A final argument against AI, particularly important for health care is regarding data privacy and the ownership of data. This is very important, especially because increasingly, clinical trials are being conducted using technology like never before. Recently, a diabetes reversal trial was conducted remotely, in part, with web-based education via the Internet.[20] In another examples, people with type 1 diabetes were recruited for a clinical trial via social media.[21] In this era, where data is called the \\u201cnew oil,\\u201d people who control and own data wield enormous power. At present, regulations seem to be ambiguous on data ownership. Surely, it stands to reason (both ethical and moral) that all personal health data must primarily belong to the patient. Given the increasing use of wearables (like smartwatches, sensors, and fitness trackers) in monitoring health parameters, ownership of data assumes greater importance to prevent \\u201ccyberattacks.\\u201d AI IS HERE TO STAY A detailed analysis of AI applications in diabetes is beyond the scope of this general article. However, it seems clear that AI is here to stay. If AI can diagnose and help in treating disease, could it take over our jobs one day? AI could have a strong role in taking over tasks which depend on automation and pattern recognition such as anatomic radiology and pathology.[22] However, in general, as clinicians, it is safe to assume that AI is not after our jobs! Clinical assessment, empathy, the human touch and judgement\\u2014all continue to be important skills for the next century. However, AI scores high in situations where there is a large amount of data to interpret, and when there is uncertainty about the right choice of treatment. In these situations, AI becomes an additional tool for the clinician. In other words, a good clinician who is not empowered with AI-based support is likely to be less effective than a good clinician who has the additional option of harnessing the benefits of AI. Notably, there are experts who feel that AI could make health care humane again.[23] This is because when the doctor is assisted by an AI-based analysis of complex clinical and laboratory data, it would free up some time which the doctor can spend in interacting with the patient. Another emerging frontier the field of \\u201cin silico\\u201d drug discovery.[24] This uses AI-enabled computer software to precisely develop and test molecules that bind to receptors in medically effective ways. This takes away drug discovery from the laboratory, allowing simulation of controlled experiments in the virtual realm. In conclusion, it is always good to know that AI is a tool, and that it is not a goal in itself. It is the goal of every endocrinology specialist to provide high-quality diabetes care and AI is only a tool to achieve that goal. The tool can never replace the caregiver or the goal. As endocrinologists, we must recognize that AI is here to stay. While understanding the merits and demerits of AI in diabetes care, we could still welcome it with a cautious optimism.\", \"url\": \"https://openalex.org/W2990642213\"}, {\"x\": 1.6035585403442383, \"y\": -1.5425617694854736, \"source\": \"openalex\", \"cluster\": 1, \"cluster_name\": \"AI in education\", \"cluster_description\": \"This cluster of documents focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in early childhood education, exploring how AI can enhance learning experiences and develop children's skills.

These differences are often revealed using areas of interest that are chosen by the experimenter or other human observers. In contrast, we adopted a data-driven approach by using machine learning (Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Learning (DL)) to elucidate factors that contribute to age-related variability in gaze patterns.

A subset of serotonin\\u2010producing (5\\u2010HT) neurons develop an apparent intrinsic chemosensitivity to HA after ~P12, but the molecular mechanisms driving their cellular pH/CO2 sensitivity remains unknown.

ABSTRACT Objectives Although there have been remarkable strides in fetal medicine and prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease, a significant percentage of newborns with isolated coarctation of the aorta (CoA) \\u2010 around 60 percent \\u2010 are still not identified prior to birth. The prenatal detection of CoA has been shown to have a notable impact on the survival rates of affected infants. To this end, the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in fetal ultrasound may represent a groundbreaking advancement. Our hypothesis is that leveraging automated cardiac biometric measurements with AI during the 18\\u201022\\u2010week anomaly scan will enhance the identification of fetuses that are at risk of developing CoA. Methods We have developed an AI model capable of identifying standard cardiac planes and conducting automated cardiac biometric measurements. Our data consisted of pregnancy ultrasound image and outcome data spanning from 2008 to 2018 and collected from four distinct regions in Denmark. The CoA cases from the period were paired with healthy controls in a ratio of 1:100 and matched on gestational ages of \\u00b12 days. The cardiac biometrics on the four\\u2010chamber view and three vessel view were included in a logistic regression\\u2010based prediction model. To assess the predictive capabilities, we visualized sensitivity and specificity on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Results At the 18\\u201022 week scan, the right ventricle (RV)area and length, left ventricle (LV) width, and the ratios of RV/LV areas and main pulmonary artery/ascending aorta diameters showed significant differences with z\\u2010scores above 0.7 when comparing subjects with a postnatal diagnosis of CoA (n=73) and healthy controls (n=7300). Using logistic regression and backward feature selection, our prediction model produced a ROC curve with an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 0.96 and a specificity of 88.9% at a sensitivity level of 90.4%. Conclusion The integration of AI technology with automated cardiac biometric measurements conducted during the 18\\u201022\\u2010week anomaly scan in fetal medicine has the potential to substantially enhance the screening for fetal CoA and subsequently the rate of CoA detection.

The article by C. Maddaloni and coauthors addresses two continuously important and central topics in neonatology, sepsis and birth asphyxia.1 Despite active research for decades we do not yet have robust early biomarkers and diagnostic criteria for detection of sepsis on one hand and which asphyxiated infants will develop hypoxic\\u2013ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) eligible for hypothermia treatment on the other hand. Some asphyxiated infants do have a concomitant infection and thereby the morbidities overlap. The decision to start hypothermia treatment is still based on the old asphyxia criteria, low Apgar scores and acidosis at birth, we and others studied in the 1980's.2 Presepsin (sCD14-ST) is the soluble N-terminal fragment of the CD14 receptor, released from cells of innate immunity (monocytes, dendritic cells and neutrophils) upon bacterial interaction. CD14 is a high-affinity receptor for lipopolysaccharides and through the toll-like receptor 4 signalling pathway the proinflammatory cascade is initiated and presepsin is rapidly detached and detectable in the circulation.1 In the present study, the authors have used the point-of-care method (PATHFAST\\u00ae) that gives a bedside result within 15 min.1 An early robust biomarker for both early onset (EOS) and late onset sepsis in newborn infants would decrease the unnecessary use of antibiotics. Several studies have estimated normal range for the concentration in umbilical cord blood and then explored the possibility to use presepsin as an early predictor EOS. A recent study on predicting EOS with cord presepsin concentration reported an AUC of 0.825 (95% CI = 0.710\\u20130.909) for a cut-off level of 579 pg/mL, corresponding to a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 70% for term infants.3 For preterm infants using cut-off at 544 pg/mL the AUC was 0.710 (95% CI = 0.513\\u20130.862), corresponding to a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 76%.3 In another study on severity of neonatal sepsis, presepsin had a similar performance for the early diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock, superior to C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. However, at onset of sepsis, there was no difference in presepsin values between culture positive and negative cases that is a considerable draw-back for the usefulness of the biomarker.4 The traditional sepsis biomarkers C-reactive protein and procalcitonin are increasing during the first days of life in asphyxiated infants and thereby a source of false positive result for EOS.1, 5 The present study set out to investigate whether asphyxia causes an increase in presepsin in a case control study including 25 HIE infants undergoing hypothermia.1 A previous case control study on 30 asphyxiated infants found an increased cord plasma presepsin level of a similar magnitude as in the first urine sample and a normalisation of the urine concentration at 48 h of age.5 As they only had a plasma sample from umbilical cord blood, no data were available of the development of blood concentrations. Unfortunately, in the present study,1 the first blood samples were not obtained exactly at same time points in HIE and control group infants, and therefore, a possible difference in concentrations might have been missed. In the HIE infants, the decreasing trend in blood and urine concentrations was non-significant. The results should be interpreted with caution. Taken together from the results of the studies so far published, asphyxia seems to be associated with an increased presepsin level at birth. Birth asphyxia causes a metabolic chaos in the newborn infant and thus increased levels of a wide range of biomarkers have been found in umbilical cord blood, including catecholamines,6 lactate, hypoxanthine, vasopressin and erythropoietin, however, with low predictive value for adverse outcome.7 The hunting for more robust biomarkers goes on. The achievements during the last 20 years have recently been collected in a meta-analysis, suggesting that the most promising biomarkers should be included in a panel for future studies, that is glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase isozyme-L1 (UCHL1), glutamic pyruvic transaminase-2, alanine amino transferase, glutamate and lactate for HIE severity as well as neuron specific enolase (NSE) and S100B for outcome prediction.8 Multicentre collaboration is a prerequisite to achieve robust results, as HIE is rare. Within the erythropoietin trial collaboration HEAL, 180 of the 500 hypothermia treated infants were included in a proteomics study, where collected plasma samples from days 1, 2 and 4 were analysed to identify early predictive biomarkers for adverse outcome.9 The authors concluded that after adjustment for multiple comparisons six plasma biomarkers significantly improved the estimation of death or adverse development compared to clinical findings: C5a, interleukin-6 and NSE at baseline; interleukin-8, tau and UCHL1 at day four. However, the increase in correct classification was only 16%. It would be interesting to perform a secondary analysis of presepsin concentration in their data base. For asphyxiated infants, earlier biomarkers than used in the HEAL trial are needed to discriminate shortly after birth which infant will develop HIE to be able to initiate hypothermia as soon as possible, with or without new additional therapy. With the use of machine learning a collaborative group has addressed this question of early diagnosis by analysing fetal heart rate epochs together with uterine pressure in a multicentre population of over 40 000 deliveries.10 With a random forest classification for intervention they could identify 16% more infants with metabolic acidosis and 6% more infants developing HIE than using clinical decisions. The intervention alert included in the algorithm was elicited about 200 min before the delivery, showing that algorithms of fetal heart rate signals may improve the anticipation of delivery problems.10 A very recent study used State Inpatient Databases, a collection of state-specific hospital discharge abstract data made available by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project in United States, to analyse possibility to improve diagnosis of HIE.11 The authors utilised data from 836 216 birth records with matching maternal labour and delivery records, of which 376 (0.045%) had a diagnosis of HIE (0.45 per 1000 live births) and identified 24 risk factors and 4 protective factors that in their model had an optimism-adjusted area under the ROC curve of 0.84. They showed that by the identification of novel risk factors some labour and deliveries in the US population have an overall HIE risk in excess of 39%. In the future, we can expect more large data collection to be used for diagnostic modelling in different populations. With international collaboration using digitalised patient data and suggested biomarkers assessed at birth and during the first days of life, artificial intelligence will in the future probably help on one hand to discriminate fetal hazards during delivery requiring early caesarean section and on the other facilitate early identification of infants with high HIE risk and thereby enable early initiation of hypothermia treatment. Implementing a panel of early biomarkers for asphyxia severity will probably help clinicians to distinguish between deterioration caused by asphyxia and sepsis. Future studies are needed to show the concentrations of presepsin in different asphyxia severities and development of the concentrations over the first day of life. Thereby valuable information of the robustness of the presepsin biomarker for EOS will be available.

Several studies have described the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in risk prediction of PE and its subtypes. A systematic review of available literature is necessary to catalogue the current applications of AI/ML methods in early pregnancy screening for PE, in order to better inform the development of clinically relevant risk prediction algorithms which will enable timely intervention and the development of new treatment strategies. The aim of this systematic review is to identify and assess studies regarding the application of AI/ML methods in first-trimester screening for PE. Methods A systematic review of peer-reviewed as well as the grey literature cohort or case-control studies will be conducted. Relevant information will be accessed from the following databases; PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Arxiv, BioRxiv, and MedRxiv.

Reasoning about diamonds, gravity and mental states: The cognitive costs of theory of mind Ben Meijering 1 (b.meijering@rug.nl), Hedderik van Rijn 2 , Niels A. Taatgen 1 , and Rineke Verbrugge 1 Institute of Artificial Intelligence, PO Box 407 9700 AK Groningen, The Netherlands Department of Psychology, Grote Kruisstraat 2/1 NL-9712 TS Groningen Abstract Theory of mind (ToM) is required when reasoning about mental states such as knowledge, beliefs, desires, and intentions. Many complex reasoning tasks require domain- general cognitive resources such as planning, resistance to interference, and working memory. In this paper we present a study of the additional cognitive costs of reasoning about mental states. We presented participants with sequential games in which they have to reason about another player. In the so-called player condition, the other player is reasoning about the participant, whereas in the so-called balance condition, the other player is reasoning about a balance scale. Both types of games require the same comparisons, but only differ in the required depth of ToM reasoning. Games in the player condition require one additional switch between perspectives. The results show that participants make different types of mistakes in the player condition as compared to the balance condition. This finding implies a different reasoning process when reasoning about mental states. The results also show faster decreasing reaction times in the balance condition than in the player condition. Based on these findings, we argue that reasoning about mental states requires unique cognitive resources. Keywords: Theory of mind; perspective taking; decision making; sequential games; social cognition. Introduction In many social interactions we reason about one another. If, for example, our decisions or outcomes depend on someone else\\u2019s actions, we try to predict what the other will do. Predicting the other\\u2019s actions requires an understanding of how behaviors are caused by mental states such as beliefs, desires, goals, et cetera. Such an understanding is often referred to as theory of mind (Premack & Woodruff, 1978). A theory of mind, or ToM, is starting to develop around the age of three to four years (Wellman, Cross, & Watson, 2001; Wimmer & Perner, 1983). However, younger infants already are susceptible to others\\u2019 mental states (Onishi & Baillargeon, 2005). One possible explanation is that they are able to read others\\u2019 behavior, but cannot yet explicitly reason about the underlying mental states. Only after many interactions, reading many distinct behaviors, do children start to develop a theory of how behaviors generally correspond with beliefs, desires, intentions, et cetera. So far, we have introduced ToM as being a theory (Gopnik & Wellman, 1992). However, we do not want to exclude another definition of ToM that considers it to be an ability or skill to reason about mental states of oneself and others (Apperly, 2011; Leslie, Friedman, & German, 2004; Van Rij, Van Rijn, & Hendriks, 2010; Wimmer & Perner, 1983). In fact, a theory alone would not suffice when reasoning about others\\u2019 mental states. Such reasoning is an entire process of generating many possible mental state interpretations (Baker, Saxe, & Tenenbaum, 2009), and ToM reasoning might be qualitatively different from other kinds of reasoning. Some studies have shown similar but uncorrelated developmental trends in ToM tasks and non-mental tasks that require similar representations (Arslan, Hohenberger, & Verbrugge, 2012; Flobbe, Verbrugge, Hendriks, & Kramer, 2008). For example, a relative clause in the sentence \\u201cThe goat that pushes the cat\\u201d requires a similar representation as the complement clause in \\u201cAlice knows that Bob is writing\\u201d, but only the complement clause requires a mental state representation. As children become older, they get better at understanding both types of sentences. However, their performance does not correlate when the factor age is controlled for. These findings show that ToM tasks might consume unique cognitive resources. It is important to note, however, that these tasks might have differed with respect to other factors, besides the aspect of mental representations. Some studies show similar performance in ToM tasks, on the one hand, and equivalent but non-mental control tasks, on the other. In the false-belief or Sally-Anne task, for example, children have to attribute a false belief about an object\\u2019s current location to Sally (Wellman et al., 2001; Wimmer & Perner, 1983). Sally stores an object at location A, but the object is moved from location A to location B while Sally is away. Therefore, Sally still thinks that the object is at location A. To pass this task, children should acknowledge that Sally falsely believes that the object is still at location A. The false-sign task is a similar but non- mental counterpart of the false-belief task. An object is first stored at location A, indicated by an arrow. Next, the object is moved from location A to location B, but the arrow still points at location A. The false sign in this task is the arrow pointing at location A, which is similar to Sally\\u2019s false belief. Children\\u2019s accuracy in both tasks is similar, and their performance correlates, even after correcting for age (Apperly, 2011; Leekam, Perner, Healey, & Sewell, 2008; Sabbagh, Xu, Carlson, Moses, & Kang, 2006). This finding implies that mental state reasoning might not qualitatively differ from other kinds of reasoning.\", \"url\": \"https://openalex.org/W2405532557\"}, {\"x\": -0.33762601017951965, \"y\": 2.9001948833465576, \"source\": \"openalex\", \"cluster\": 3, \"cluster_name\": \"Machine learning for child development\", \"cluster_description\": \"This cluster captures innovations in using machine learning and predictive models to assess and predict various aspects of infant and child development, including health, cognitive outcomes, language development, and risk factors for conditions like asthma and obesity.

However, there has been a paucity of research focused on developing targeted therapies to treat a malfunctioning placenta and on novel assessment techniques to monitor the placenta throughout gestation. For the past 6 years, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has funded innovative research on placental biology and function through the Human Placenta Project. In conjunction with this month's special topic issue on the placenta, we sat down with the director of Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Dr Diana Bianchi, to learn about the past, present, and future direction of placental research at the National Institutes of Health.interviewJill Maron, MD, MPH: Dr. Bianchi, as the essential conduit between the mother and fetus, the placenta plays a decisive role in nutrient transport, gas, exchange and barrier protection during gestation, yet it's often considered the forgotten organ by patients and caregivers. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), where you serve as the director, has long recognized the role of a healthy placenta for a healthy pregnancy. Since 2014, the NICHD has funded the Human Placenta Project (HPP) aimed at generating an improved understanding of human placental biology and developing innovative tools and approaches for real-time assessment of the placenta across gestation. What do you consider as some of the most impactful research that has been generated through the HPP?Diana Bianchi, MD: Thanks for introducing the Human Placenta Project, which has been a significant investment for the NICHD. We've invested around $80 million into this program. Now that we're just about 6 years into the program, it's a great time to take stock. As you mentioned, we're very interested in the placenta. In fact, we often say that the placenta is NICHD's organ. None of the other institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seem to dispute that claim. It's the one organ for which we can say that we really are the lead research funders.I think we should probably explain to your readers why the Child Health Institute is so interested in the placenta. It's because about 30% of our portfolio funds research relate to maternal health, and the placenta is considered to be part of maternal health. We think that a healthy pregnancy is so important that it's in the first line in our vision statement, which is \\u201chealthy pregnancies, healthy children, healthy and optimal lives.\\u201d As you also probably know, we recently developed a strategic plan and released it publicly. It is available to anyone with internet access. The link is https://www.nichd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/NICHD_Strategic_Plan.pdf.After much discussion, however, 1 of our 5 scientific themes is related to pregnancy, not just pregnancy per se or pregnancy ending after 8 or 9 months. Rather, it's really how pregnancy sets the foundation for a lifetime of well-being. So that brings us to the human side of the project or the HPP. The HPP was designed to noninvasively and in real time determine what is a typically developing placenta doing and what is an atypically developing placenta doing, and how can you best monitor that, because although you can examine a placenta, it's only accessible after the baby has been born. So how can you prospectively identify or distinguish between pregnancies that are going well and those that are not going well and perhaps target management accordingly? Right now, as you know, we have this very infrequent care paradigm in which the pregnant person only sees the obstetrician occasionally in the beginning of the pregnancy and then very frequently at the end, when it might be too late. If you reverse that paradigm, then perhaps you might identify the pregnancies that are going to become high risk.What have been the impactful studies that we have funded? Overall, the HPP was directed toward imaging studies and then circulating factors. There has been a tremendous amount of progress because, first of all, in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the placenta, the challenges have included motion of both the mother and fetus and the hesitancy to use contrast media, such as gadolinium, because of potential harm to the fetus. So, some of the improvements and the impact are likely to be related to the fact that techniques have been developed to reduce motion artifacts but also to use more physiologic types of contrast. In particular, there are several HPP-funded investigators, such as Drs. Ellen Grant at Harvard,1Abaci Turk E. Abulnaga S.M.

This so-called BOLD MRI stands for blood oxygen level\\u2013dependent MRI. This imaging has progressed significantly over the course of the HPP. Ultrasound as a diagnostic tool has been available for close to 40 years, but if you look at the early images, they were so fuzzy and abstract compared to what is available now. A major issue, however, has been interoperator variability. For example, even rolling out something like the measurement of the nuchal translucency at the back of the fetal neck as a risk factor for Down syndrome and cardiovascular disease took at least 10 years to get it to the point where it could transfer from the UK, where it was standard of care, to the United States and become incorporated into care because of tremendous variability. If you didn't have the fetus at the right angle, you artificially enlarged the nuchal translucency, and suddenly that fetus was at risk when in fact it was a technique issue.A lot of what has been done in the HPP is to automate image analysis and then use artificial intelligence and machine learning to be able to predict which pregnancies are at high risk for complications.

Dr. Abuhamad is at Eastern Virginia Medical School, and Dr. Saade is at the University of Texas, Galveston. They are using a new ultrasound technique called superb microvascular imaging to obtain data across the time course of pregnancy. To date, these are the major impactful advances in HPP.There are also a lot of advances in the circulating factors: cell-free DNA, methylated DNA, circulating RNA, proteins, lipids, exosomes, and all kinds of novel isolation technologies. For example, Drs. Tony Wang at Duke, Yoel Sadovsky at Magee Women's in Pittsburgh,8Chang G. Mouillet J.F.

Altered level of salivary placental growth factor is associated with preeclampsia.Placenta. 2020 Jan 15; 90: 118-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar There have been significant challenges in terms of defining what is normal. Of course, you need access to large cohorts. That's kind of where things are moving now because initially it was about technology development, and now it's applying the technology to large cohorts of known typical and known complicated pregnancies.Dr Maron: I think both those areas are important. Your point about biological variability in these large cohorts is extremely important. You begin to understand that you can't begin to detect the abnormal without the baseline for the normal variability that we're seeing throughout gestation. One of the things your career certainly has been defined by is the circulating factors. You spent so many years developing noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT). For those readers who do not understand the important role the placenta plays in NIPT, it would be wonderful if you could lay a foundation of the basis of NIPT, now that it is standard practice, and the role the placenta plays in NIPT.Dr Bianchi: Thanks, Dr Maron. I like to think of NIPT in terms of screening for aneuploidy as a liquid biopsy of the placenta. Many pregnant people, as well as their care providers, don't realize that when we do NIPT we're actually looking at nucleic acids that are released from the placenta. There may be some from the fetus, but it's just such a small amount that it's much easier to think of it as a placental biopsy. During the course of development, the placenta is constantly remodeling itself. While that is happening there are cells that are undergoing apoptosis and necrosis. As those cells are being metabolized, there is a huge amount of cell free nucleic acids that are released into the mother's circulation. So, when we take a blood sample from a pregnant person, we're not isolating what we think is fetal or placental DNA. When you're screening for aneuploidy, you are really looking at ratios comparing that person's blood sample to what would be expected in a typically developing pregnancy with a female fetus. The references assume 2 copies of every autosome and 2 copies of the X chromosome\\u2014the mother and the fetus. If you see excess or deficiency of a particular chromosome, it suggests that something is unbalanced. The exception would be if there is deficiency of the X with a Y chromosome signal present, which is what you would find if the person is carrying a male fetus. Each of the commercial laboratories do things slightly differently, but the gist of it is that for Down syndrome, you're looking for evidence of an excess of chromosome 21 signals. You're sequencing fragments of DNA and mapping them to the human genome, and then you are analyzing them via a sophisticated counting algorithm. If you have excess 21, it suggests that the fetus has Down syndrome. The technology has gone significantly beyond that. It was initially developed as a screen for the common autosomal aneuploidies (trisomies 13, 18, 21), but quite rapidly it moved to the sex chromosome aneuploidies. So now, for example, we are learning prenatally in a way that we never learned before, that a baby boy is going to have Klinefelter syndrome. These are babies who typically don't have congenital anomalies, and they look perfect at birth so you wouldn't know otherwise. The argument for screening is that by knowing it, you're able to treat them postnatally. It's not a condition for which you would want to treat prenatally. For Klinefelter syndrome, if you know early on you can provide special education if needed, you can provide testosterone if needed, etc. Now NIPT has gone beyond common autosomal and sex chromosome aneuploidies to the rare autosomal trisomies. There is a pressing biologic question, \\u201cIf there are trisomies detected in the placenta, is that harmful to the developing fetus?\\u201d You could have confined placental mosaicism, for example, or you could have a mosaic fetal trisomy that might never be detected unless you found out via NIPT. So, the testing has expanded relatively rapidly. There is also now what is called NIPD, which is noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of single-gene disorders.Mendelian conditions, such as skeletal dysplasias, are probably the most common application for NIPD. If you see a fetus with short limbs on an ultrasound examination, and you want to know if that fetus have achondroplasia, you can do a blood test on the mother and pretty quickly figure it out because the kinds of mutations that you see in achondroplasia are fairly limited. So, if you have a fetus with short bones on ultrasound, and you have typical findings on the maternal blood tests in the DNA, you can pretty much noninvasively make the diagnosis of achondroplasia prenatally.And then you get to RNA. Dr Maron, I think that your important JCI publication never got the attention that it deserved. It was very ahead of its time.10Maron J.L. Johnson K.L.

But it wasn't until more recently that people began to use gene expression information via RNA sequencing to determine, first of all, is there a gestational clock? What genes are expressed as a fetus is getting ready to deliver? Are there certain genes that are required for a term delivery? This is work of the Quake lab in which they are looking for biomarkers that will predict fetuses that will deliver prematurely.11Ngo T.T.M. Moufarrej M.N. Rasmussen M.H. et al.Noninvasive blood tests for fetal development predict gestational age and preterm delivery.Science. 2018 Jun 8; 360: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar Interestingly, some of those expressed genes appear to be maternal in origin. The mother, not necessarily the fetus, is controlling the timing. Even more recently, this year work from the Illumina group demonstrated a paradigm to predict preeclampsia.12Munchel S. Rohrback S. Randise-Hinchliff C. et al.Circulating transcripts in maternal blood reflect a molecular signature of early-onset preeclampsia.Sci Transl Med. 2020 Jul 1; (eaaz0131): 12Google Scholar This is all in blood, however, and I know that you've had a recent publication on maternal saliva and detecting placental growth factor in it.9Rao S.L. Taymoori A. Wong D.T.W. Maron J.L. Altered level of salivary placental growth factor is associated with preeclampsia.Placenta. 2020 Jan 15; 90: 118-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar The investigators who are analyzing maternal blood, who are using gene sequencing, they are relying on artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to look at pregnancy outcomes and a combination of what's expressed in full-term pregnancies vs preterm pregnancies, or what's expressed in pregnancies that did not have hypertension and those that had early or late preeclampsia. This is all very exciting because it suggests that we're going to be able to predict hypertension before a woman develop symptoms.Dr Maron: It is really exciting. As you alluded to, my interest in messenger RNA in the fetal transcriptome was always focused on real-time, dynamic changes. We've come so far with genetic testing and genetic screening and diagnosis to understand in the moment what's going on in that pregnancy. It is really exciting because at the end of the day, we're limited by what trials we can do and what drugs we can develop if we don't know what our targets are and we don't know when we should intervene. So, I do think the work emerging from Quake's lab and others is really very, very exciting.Dr Bianchi: But I would just say that I think that people who don't work on pregnancy or who are not used to the placenta or the fetus don't realize how fast things change during development. For example, when you have controls, you need to have a control from the same gestational week because so many different genes are going to be expressed in the next week.Dr Maron: Absolutely true, and as a neonatologist, that doesn't change when babies are born early. Every week, we must control for that ongoing development that continues, albeit disrupted, by preterm birth. So then, where do you think the HPP is going with all of these exciting developments?Dr Bianchi: So again, we're at the 6-year point for the HPP. We had originally planned to have a reflection and determine future strategies around the 5-year point, but that was all interrupted by the pandemic. We are planning a future workshop for May 10 to 11, 2021. I really do believe that one of the benefits of the pandemic has been to make NIH-sponsored workshops much more accessible to investigators all over the world. Before, when we held a workshop like the HPP, we could only invite a couple of hundred people because that was the capacity of our auditorium. The people who were in the room at that time received advance notice of the progress to date and where gaps and opportunities existed. What I really love about doing things virtually, however, is that it really democratizes the whole process and allows any and all investigators to hear summaries of what has been accomplished to date and then be in on the conversations about what lies ahead.D. Maron: At NICHD, you really have been a proponent on improving and increasing research to benefit maternal health, particularly in including pregnant persons in clinical trials and in research. Can you tell us why this is important and how your institute has advanced this effort?Dr Bianchi: This is a daily struggle. It's so important. Ninety percent of women experience pregnancy at some point in their lifetime, and their metabolism changes. You're dealing with 2 individuals instead of 1. Historically, there has been a very paternalistic attitude toward pregnant persons in that they need to be protected from research instead of through research. Via a number of different mechanisms, we have tried to change that paradigm. First of all, pregnant people are adults who should be able to think for themselves and consider the risks and benefits. I'm very pleased to see that in the last few days the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine have both stated publicly that pregnant persons should be allowed to get the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 even though it hasn't been specifically tested in pregnant people. There were some subjects who became pregnant or who were very early in their pregnancies in the Pfizer trial, but there's been this overall attitude that pregnant people can't make decisions for themselves and that the safest thing is to not expose the fetus to any medication. In fact, if a patient has asthma or hypertension or diabetes, they need to be treated. It's in the fetus' best interests to have its mother in optimal health. That the pregnant person needs to stay away from all of that is, I think, an old-fashioned idea.NICHD was fortunate to have the opportunity to lead the federal Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women (PRGLAC). The PRGLAC Task Force included members from industry, various federal agencies, and various extramural investigators to talk about how we get to the point in which a pregnant person can participate in research and why is it so crucial to do so (https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/advisory/PRGLAC).In 2018, we submitted a list of 15 recommendations (https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/advisory/PRGLAC/recommendations).To Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Azar, and that was great, but we didn't want that set of recommendations to sit on a shelf. So, then we convened a follow-up group to discuss implementation of those recommendations. This was submitted to HHS in September of this year (https://www.nichd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/PRGLAC_Implement_Plan_083120.pdf).In my mind, the whole issue of getting pregnant people into the studies with regard to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is a perfect example of where the rubber needs to meet the road and why our recommendations need to be implemented. Pregnant people are an important part of our society. We have a little over 6 million pregnancies per year in the United States alone. It's an important population, and pregnant people are carrying the future people of our country.Dr Maron: Absolutely. We continue to fly by the seat of our pants when the mother is confronted with an illness due to our failure to understand what the best drugs and best treatments are for use in pregnancy. It does no one any good. It only puts both mother and baby further at risk, and we have many examples to learn from. I am hopeful with SARS-CoV-2, we will move this forward as your institute's hoping to do, which brings me to one of the final areas I wanted to touch base on in our interview: social determinants of health, including racial and economic disparities and their impact on disease outcomes and access to care. We've long known that race has played an important part in prematurity, with the black population certainly at increased risk relative to the white population. I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on the role that race may play on placental function and pregnancy outcomes, specifically.Dr Bianchi: So, that is a complicated issue, and it's something that's very much on the institute's minds in our strategic plan. We had health disparities as one of the top cross-cutting factors, meaning that we wanted health disparities to be part of everything we do. When I was in training, the prevailing wisdom was that racial or health disparities were the result of decreased access to care, or even the genome\\u2014that there were genomic differences. Now we realize that it's much more complicated. Lifetimes of stress and poverty, food insecurity and not having access to medical care, not having the transportation to get to the care, all of these things combined certainly affect how genes are expressed. We also realize that this is transgenerational. To address these problems, you really have to get at some of the underlying social determinants of health. That is why social determinants of health are taking a bigger role now in everything that we fund.There's no bigger area than in maternal mortality, in which you see significant racial differences in black and Alaska Native/American Indian women, who have 3 to 4 times higher chances of dying during pregnancy or postpartum than women who are Hispanic or white. Identifying who is at risk of dying during pregnancy is quite similar to assessing the placenta because we are looking for relatively rare events. Somewhere around 900 pregnant women per year in the US will die either during pregnancy or in the year following childbirth. But how do you determine who they are? That's another area in which if you knew early on that the placenta was not functioning well, you could identify women who are at high risk of pregnancy complications or mortality. That's something that we hope to do with a new trans-NIH initiative called IMPROVE (Implementing a Maternal Health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone) (https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/improve-initiative) that looks at biomarkers as well as social determinants of health. But it's so complicated because black women are also at higher risk for developing hypertension (and preeclampsia). Through some of the imaging studies that the HPP is doing, you can analyze the blood vessels in the placenta, and ideally, you'll be able to predict who's at risk for developing cardiovascular disease postpartum.Dr Maron: It sounds like an amazing opportunity for the HPP to really look at these disparities in its next phase because the placenta may hold more clues than we ever knew before, particularly as you move these projects forward. Well, I want to thank you for taking the time. Are there any additional points that you thought we should address?Dr Bianchi: We didn't talk about treatment. I know that's going to be in a number of the articles in this issue. Getting women to high-risk maternity centers is an important part of treatment, but I think the future will be pharmacologic treatment and/or even gene therapy. There's a lot of work that's currently being done to address fetal growth restriction, whether it's treating with heparin or aspirin. In the future, and it's only been done an animal models so far, various gene therapies to improve vascular flow to the fetus may also be possible.Dr Maron: Absolutely. Even using targeted nanoparticles to directly go to the placenta is on the forefront. I think these are all areas that hold great potential, and we are highlighting them in our special topic issue this month.Dr Bianchi: A good way to end!Dr Maron: Well, again, I want to thank you so much, Dr Bianchi for taking the time to meet with us. As always, you hold valuable insights into maternal and child health as well as placental health. We look forward to learning more about this exciting research at NICHD. Thank you very much for being with us today.Dr Bianchi: Thank you. It's been my pleasure. Featured Guest Biography: Dr Diana W.

Background Cardiotocography (CTG) records the fetal heart rate in relation to maternal uterine contractions and is one of the most common forms of fetal assessment during labour. Despite guidelines for CTG interpretation, substantial inter\\u2010 and intra\\u2010observer variation in interpretation has been reported among maternity care providers. Misinterpretation of CTG readings can lead to poor decisions, which can result in unnecessary intervention or delay or withholding of necessary intervention. Expert systems (ESs) represent a type of applied artificial intelligence, which can assist in complex clinical decision\\u2010making and potentially serve as a mechanism to improve interpretation of fetal heart rate tracings. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of continuous or intermittent CTG monitoring during labour with an ES compared with (1) continuous or intermittent CTG monitoring during labour without an ES or (2) intermittent auscultation with a Pinard stethoscope or hand\\u2010held Doppler ultrasound device. Outcomes of interest included incidence of perinatal mortality, caesarean delivery, operative vaginal birth, fetal blood sampling, artificial rupture of amniotic membranes, oxytocin augmentation of labour, maternal satisfaction with labour, neonatal seizures, fetal acidaemia, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, admission to neonatal special care and/or neonatal intensive care unit and an Apgar score less than seven at five minutes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (27 October 2014), Open Grey (6 October 2014) ProQuest Dissertation & Theses Database (6 October 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi\\u2010randomised controlled trials comparing continuous or intermittent CTG monitoring during labour with an ES with continuous or intermittent CTG monitoring without an ES were eligible for this review. Trials comparing continuous or intermittent CTG monitoring during labour with an ES with intermittent auscultation with a Pinard or hand\\u2010held Doppler were also eligible. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of the trials as well as extracted data to ensure accuracy. The authors of included trials were contacted to clarify aspects of the study design that were not clearly reported in the original trial publications. Main results No studies comparing CTG monitoring during labour with an ES to intermittent auscultation were identified. Two randomised controlled trials comparing CTG monitoring during labour with an ES versus CTG without an ES were identified and included in the qualitative synthesis of results, but only one trial (n = 220) provided data for quantitative analysis. Both trials were classified as low risk of bias. There was no strong evidence that CTG with an ES has an effect on the incidence of caesarean delivery (risk ratio (RR) 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 1.04) when compared with CTG with fetal blood sampling.There was no strong evidence supporting a reduction in the incidence of neonatal seizures (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.01 to 8.09) or fetal acidaemia (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.09 to 2.67) in women monitored using a CTG with an ES versus a CTG without an ES. Overall perinatal mortality could not be ascertained for this trial since data on early neonatal deaths were unavailable. Although fetal deaths were recorded, no fetal deaths occurred in either arm of the trial, and thus no risk estimates could be derived. There was no strong evidence supporting a reduction in the incidence of forceps\\u2010assisted vaginal birth (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.05 to 5.43), hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.01 to 8.09), admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.08 to 2.02) or an Apgar less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.95). The trial did not report on artificial rupture of amniotic membranes,oxytocin augmentation of labour ormaternal satisfaction with labour. Authors' conclusions Two trials met the inclusion criteria for this review but one trial did not provide data for any of this review's outcomes. The single trial that did contribute data was underpowered to evaluate the association between CTG monitoring with an ES and the primary outcomes of interest. No recommendations for clinical practice can be made at this time. Adequately powered trials are necessary before the impact of ESs for fetal assessment in labour can be determined.\", \"url\": \"https://openalex.org/W1539570032\"}, {\"x\": -1.099045991897583, \"y\": 1.8048880100250244, \"source\": \"openalex\", \"cluster\": 3, \"cluster_name\": \"Machine learning for child development\", \"cluster_description\": \"This cluster captures innovations in using machine learning and predictive models to assess and predict various aspects of infant and child development, including health, cognitive outcomes, language development, and risk factors for conditions like asthma and obesity.

Important properties of the information generation process are that it must generate accurate, timely information while protecting the confidentiality of the clients.

In this paper, we synthesis the different frameworks for utilizing big data for public governance, introduce the KDD process, describe the nature of big data in child welfare, and then present an updated KDD architecture that can support these frameworks to utilize big data for governance.

Abstract Purpose: Classical Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency affects 1:15,000 newborns and involves adrenal insufficiency and androgen excess. These hormone abnormalities are evident as early as 7 weeks\\u2019 gestation and persist throughout pregnancy. Structural brain abnormalities are also known to occur in CAH, with abnormalities of brain and facial structure occurring together in conditions such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and holoprosencephaly. As well, sex differences in facial morphology are well described in healthy individuals. Thus, we aimed to study facial features using artificial intelligence in CAH youth. Methods: We studied frontal images of the face in 57 youth with severe salt-wasting CAH (60% female; 9.4\\u00b15.5y), and 38 controls (47% female, 9.7\\u00b15.1y), acquired with an iPad v12.1. We included 32 additional controls (43% female; 4-19y) from a publicly available face image dataset (1). Applying deep learning techniques, we converted 2-D facial photos to mathematical descriptors in order to differentiate features between groups. For a given test image, our pipeline output was a predicted \\u201cCAH score\\u201d between [0,1]. Due to our small dataset, we employed K-fold cross validation to train and test our deep neural network. At each of the K-9 folds, 88% of data (468 control and 531 CAH images) were used to train the network, with the remaining data (55 control and 63 CAH images) used to test the trained network. Test results were validated in terms of area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curves (generated from predicted CAH scores of test subjects), to analyze true and false positive rates. Our pipeline automatically detected face-bounding boxes and 68 facial landmarks (dlib toolkit) which were then used to compute 27 Euclidean (linear) facial features (2,3). We performed between group analyses of features with t-tests. Results: The averaged AUC of nine folds was 0.83\\u00b10.14, representing strong predictive power as a proxy to correlating facial dysmorphology with CAH. Predicted CAH scores were different between control (0.24\\u00b10.33) and CAH (0.69\\u00b10.37; p&amp;lt;0.0001) youth. Thirteen of 27 facial features were different between controls and CAH (p&amp;lt;0.05 for all) including 3 of 6 features related to sexual dimorphism. We also produced heat (i.e., saliency) maps showing the effect of CAH on facial features, and 2D t-SNE plot visualization of features showing well-defined separation between CAH and control group clusters. Conclusions: Utilizing deep learning, we have shown that CAH youth have facial features that can reliably distinguish them from controls.
