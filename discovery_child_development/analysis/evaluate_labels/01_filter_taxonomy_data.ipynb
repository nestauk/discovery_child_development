Clean and healthy living behavior is a big challenge in early childhood education, especially during the Clean and healthy living behavior is a big challenge in early childhood education, especially during the covid 19 pandemic. One of the primary keys, in this case, is the disciplined character of children. This study aims to analyze the character of children's discipline in implementing Clean and Healthy Life Behavior during the Covid-19 Pandemic. This research is a type of qualitative research with a descriptive approach. Data analysis was carried out by systematically analyzing data obtained from interviews, field notes, and other materials so that they were quickly accessible and informed to others. The results showed that children's discipline in implementing Clean and Healthy Behavior (PHBS) during the Covid-19 pandemic was optimal. It showed the character of the following actions: using masks or face shields, hand washing discipline, and discipline in the application. From social distancing, discipline in activities, discipline in consuming healthy food, and discipline in maintaining environmental cleanliness. Then the factors that influence the disciplined character of children in implementing clean and healthy living behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic consist of internal factors in the form of habits and heredity and external factors in the form of education and environmental factors.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Use of Wearable Devices to Study Physical Activity in Early Childhood Education. Physical activity recommendations for early childhood are gradually being met to a lesser extent today. The objectives of the study were: (i) to assess the degree of compliance with physical activity (PA) recommendations by gender; and (ii) to analyze the level of PA and steps in different periods over a week. This study was an observational cross-sectional study. Sixty-three young children (33 boys and 30 girls) aged two years (2.15 ± 0.35) were recruited for this study. Participants wore a “Garmin vivofit® jr.” activity tracker for seven days, collecting minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and step volume (Out-of-School Time and School Time). The results show a 50% compliance of the 120 min/day MVPA and 13,000 steps per day. No gender differences were detected. The findings in the analysis indicated a trend towards higher PA and steps at the Weekend. Moreover, participants reached higher PA and steps values “Out-of-School Time” than “School Time” (MVPA) (min/day). This study can provide strategies and motivational PA guidelines at school to enhance well-being at an early age. These activity trackers could stimulate more sustainable forms of urban mobility, such as walking, as the environment would accompany the child to meet daily PA recommendations.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Behavior Profiles at 2 Years for Children Born Extremely Preterm with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia. Objective To characterize behavior of 2-year-old children based on the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Study design We studied children born at 22-26 weeks of gestation and assessed at 22-26 months of corrected age with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). BPD was classified by the level of respiratory support at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. CBCL syndrome scales were the primary outcomes. The relationship between BPD grade and behavior was evaluated, adjusting for perinatal confounders. Mediation analysis was performed to evaluate whether cognitive, language, or motor skills mediated the effect of BPD grade on behavior. Results Of 2310 children, 1208 (52%) had no BPD, 806 (35%) had grade 1 BPD, 177 (8%) had grade 2 BPD, and 119 (5%) had grade 3 BPD. Withdrawn behavior (P &lt; .001) and pervasive developmental problems (P &lt; .001) increased with worsening BPD grade. Sleep problems (P = .008) and aggressive behavior (P = .023) decreased with worsening BPD grade. Children with grade 3 BPD scored 2 points worse for withdrawn behavior and pervasive developmental problems and 2 points better for externalizing problems, sleep problems, and aggressive behavior than children without BPD. Cognitive, language, and motor skills mediated the effect of BPD grade on the attention problems, emotionally reactive, somatic complaints, and withdrawn CBCL syndrome scales (P values &lt; .05). Conclusions BPD grade was associated with increased risk of withdrawn behavior and pervasive developmental problems but with decreased risk of sleep problems and aggressive behavior. The relationship between BPD and behavior is complex. Cognitive, language, and motor skills mediate the effects of BPD grade on some problem behaviors.

From social distancing, discipline in activities, discipline in consuming healthy food, and discipline in maintaining environmental cleanliness. Then the factors that influence the disciplined character of children in implementing clean and healthy living behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic consist of internal factors in the form of habits and heredity and external factors in the form of education and environmental factors.   \n",

Physical activity recommendations for early childhood are gradually being met to a lesser extent today. The objectives of the study were: (i) to assess the degree of compliance with physical activity (PA) recommendations by gender; and (ii) to analyze the level of PA and steps in different periods over a week. This study was an observational cross-sectional study. Sixty-three young children (33 boys and 30 girls) aged two years (2.15 ± 0.35) were recruited for this study. Participants wore a “Garmin vivofit® jr.” activity tracker for seven days, collecting minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and step volume (Out-of-School Time and School Time). The results show a 50% compliance of the 120 min/day MVPA and 13,000 steps per day. No gender differences were detected. The findings in the analysis indicated a trend towards higher PA and steps at the Weekend. Moreover, participants reached higher PA and steps values “Out-of-School Time” than “School Time” (MVPA) (min/day). This study can provide strategies and motivational PA guidelines at school to enhance well-being at an early age. These activity trackers could stimulate more sustainable forms of urban mobility, such as walking, as the environment would accompany the child to meet daily PA recommendations.   \n",
       "429   Behavior Profiles at 2 Years for Children Born Extremely Preterm with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia. Objective To characterize behavior of 2-year-old children based on the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Study design We studied children born at 22-26 weeks of gestation and assessed at 22-26 months of corrected age with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). BPD was classified by the level of respiratory support at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age. CBCL syndrome scales were the primary outcomes. The relationship between BPD grade and behavior was evaluated, adjusting for perinatal confounders. Mediation analysis was performed to evaluate whether cognitive, language, or motor skills mediated the effect of BPD grade on behavior. Results Of 2310 children, 1208 (52%) had no BPD, 806 (35%) had grade 1 BPD, 177 (8%) had grade 2 BPD, and 119 (5%) had grade 3 BPD. Withdrawn behavior (P < .001) and pervasive developmental problems (P < .001) increased with worsening BPD grade. Sleep problems (P = .008) and aggressive behavior (P = .023) decreased with worsening BPD grade. Children with grade 3 BPD scored 2 points worse for withdrawn behavior and pervasive developmental problems and 2 points better for externalizing problems, sleep problems, and aggressive behavior than children without BPD. Cognitive, language, and motor skills mediated the effect of BPD grade on the attention problems, emotionally reactive, somatic complaints, and withdrawn CBCL syndrome scales (P values < .05). Conclusions BPD grade was associated with increased risk of withdrawn behavior and pervasive developmental problems but with decreased risk of sleep problems and aggressive behavior. The relationship between BPD and behavior is complex. Cognitive, language, and motor skills mediate the effects of BPD grade on some problem behaviors.
