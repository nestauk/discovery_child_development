<p></p>
<h3 style="color: #583fcf">How to annotate:</h3>
<p>You are presented with abstracts from research publications and patents, and your task is to determine whether they are about the topic, that is indicated at the top of the screen (eg "AR VR", "LITERACY" and so on)</p>
<p>If you agree with the label, then press the <span style="color:green;">green Accept</span> button (or press "A")</p>
<p>If you disagree with the label, then press the <span style="color:red;">red Reject</span> button (or press "X")</p>
<p>If you can't decide, then press the <span style="color:gray;">gray Ignore</span> button (or press spacebar)</p>
<p>The platfrom saves each annotation the moment you submit it, so you don't have to worry about losing your work.</p>
