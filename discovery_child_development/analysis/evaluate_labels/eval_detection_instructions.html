<p></p>
<h3 style="color: #583fcf">How to annotate:</h3>
<p>You are presented with abstracts from research publications and patents about child development. Your task is to determine whether they are about <b>detection</b> or <b>management</b> of child development needs - some examples might also be about <b>both</b> or <b>none</b>.</p>
<p>To speed the task up, we have already provided labels suggested by GPT-4 large language model. You can accept or correct these labels.</p>
<p>Review the suggested label, correct it if needed and then press the green button (or press "A" on your keyboard). There is also possibility to ignore an example, but I would suggest instead choosing the "???" option to indicate a particularly difficult case.</p>
<p>The platfrom saves each annotation the moment you submit it, so you don't have to worry about losing your work.</p>

<h3 style="color: #583fcf">Possible classifications:</h3>

<p><b>Detection</span></b>: The text describes a research study, method, approach, technique or tool related to measuring, detecting or predicting the level of child development. Examples include using an assessment to measure the level of a child's development; using data to measure or predict child development statistics in a local authority; using sensors and algorithms to measure and analyse child developmental aspects; and similar. Choose ONLY this category if the text does not describe in detail a specific way to manage and impact child development.</p>
<p><b>Management</span></b>: The text describes a method, approach, practice, technique or tool to improve or enhance child development. Examples include using a direct intervention to improve the level of a child's development; studying the effect of an intervention, exposure or environmental factor on the child development; using an educational app to help children learn language; using robots to help children learn new skills; and similar. Choose ONLY this category if the text does not describe in detail a specific way to measure, detect or predict child development.</p>
<p><b>Both</span></b>: The text covers BOTH Detection and Management aspects in detail, as defined above.</p>
<p><b>None</span></b>: The text does not cover child development at all, or falls outside of detection and management scope.</p>
<p><b>???</span></b>: Very hard to make any decision and would need to discuss this example with the team</p>

<p> There is also a comment box, where you can add any notes if needed.</p>
