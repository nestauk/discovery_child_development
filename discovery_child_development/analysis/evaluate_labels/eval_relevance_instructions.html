<p></p>
<h3 style="color: #583fcf">How to annotate:</h3>
<p>You are presented with abstracts from research publications and patents, and your task is to determine whether they are <b>relevant</b> to the Innovation Sweet Spots project, <b>not-relevant</b> or whether it's impossible to say (not-specified).</p>
<p>To speed the task up, we have already provided labels suggested by GPT-4 large language model. You can accept or correct these labels.</p>
<p>Review the suggested label, correct it if needed and then press the green button (or press "A" on your keyboard). There is also possibility to ignore an example, but I would suggest instead choosing the "???" option to indicate a particularly difficult case.</p>
<p>The platfrom saves each annotation the moment you submit it, so you don't have to worry about losing your work.</p>

<h3 style="color: #583fcf">Possible classifications:</h3>

<p><b>Relevant</span></b>: Text that mentions human child development. The child must be between 0 and 5 years old (including 5 year olds). The text must mention children (of the relevant age) explicitly! If the age is not specified, texts about infants, babies, toddlers, child care, preschool, early-years and early childhood education are also relevant.</p>
<p><b>Not-relevant</span></b>: Text about any other topic than child development, or if the children mentioned in the text are too old (older than 5 years old and/or already going to school). Texts about non-human children are also non-relevant (for example, monkeys, piglets, mice, rats and other animals).</p>
<p><b>Not-specified</span></b>: Text that describes human child development, but the age of the children has not been explicitly specified and cannot be inferred from the context.</p>
<p><b>???</span></b>: Very hard to make any decision and would need to discuss this example with the team</p>

<p> There is also a comment box, where you can add any notes if needed.</p>
