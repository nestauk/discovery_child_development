Background: For many psychotropic drugs, monitoring of drug concentrations in the blood (Therapeutic Drug Monitoring; TDM) has been proven useful to individualize treatments and optimize drug effects. Clinicians hereby compare individual drug concentrations to population-based reference ranges for a titration of prescribed doses. Thus, established reference ranges are pre-requisite for TDM. For psychotropic drugs, guideline-based ranges are mostly expert recommendations derived from a conglomerate of cohort and cross-sectional studies. A systematic approach for identifying therapeutic reference ranges has not been published yet. This paper describes how to search, evaluate and grade the available literature and validate published therapeutic reference ranges for psychotropic drugs. Methods\/Results: Following PRISMA guidelines, relevant databases have to be systematically searched using search terms for the specific psychotropic drug, blood concentrations, drug monitoring, positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The search should be restricted to humans, and diagnoses should be pre-specified. Therapeutic references ranges will not only base upon studies that report blood concentrations in relation to clinical effects, but will also include implications from neuroimaging studies on target engagement. Furthermore, studies reporting concentrations in representative patient populations are used to support identified ranges. Each range will be assigned a level of underlying evidence according to a systematic grading system. Discussion: Following this protocol allows a comprehensive overview of TDM literature that supports a certain reference range for a psychotropic drug. The assigned level of evidence reflects the validity of a reported range rather than experts' opinions."}

When making decisions, the amount of time remaining matters. When time horizons are long, exploring unknown options can inform later decisions, but when time horizons are short, exploiting known options should be prioritized. While adults and adolescents adapt their exploration in this way, it is unclear when such adaptation emerges and how individuals behave when time horizons are ambiguous, as in many real-life situations. We examined these questions by having 5- to 6-year-olds (N = 43), 11- to 12-year-olds (N = 40), and adult college students (N = 49) in the United States complete a Simplified Horizons Task under short, long, and ambiguous time horizons. Adaptation to time horizons increased with age: older children and adults explored more when horizons were long than when short, and while some younger children adapted to time horizons, younger children overall did not show strong evidence of adapting. Under ambiguous horizons, older children and adults preferred to exploit over explore, while younger children did not show this preference. Thus, adaptation to time horizons is evident by ages 11-12 and may begin to emerge around 5-6 years, and children decrease their tendencies to explore under short and ambiguous time horizons with development. This developmental shift may lead to less learning but more adaptive decision making. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)."}

Background Due to causing inability of self-regulation (ego depletion) and executive functions such as directed attention and visual searching for relevant information (e.g., the ball location and the position of teammates), mental fatigue impairs skilled performance in various sports. On the other hand, natural scenes could improve directed attention, which may considerably benefit visual searching ability and self-regulation. However, nature exposure as a potential intervention to improve skilled performance among mentally fatigued athletes has not been discussed thoroughly. Purpose To propose the potential intervention for the impairment of skilled performance among mentally fatigued athletes and generate a framework for future studies. Methods A narrative review was applied to search broadly across disciplines, retrieving literature from several databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCOhost). Results Thirty-three works of literature including 39 experiments (mental fatigue 15; ego depletion 5; and nature exposure 19) were obtained. Finally, a conceptual framework was built regarding the effect of nature exposure intervention on skilled performance in athletes for future studies. Conclusion Three theories (the psychobiological model of exercise performance, the strength model of self-regulation, and attention restoration theory) could be potentially integrated to be a conceptual framework and explain the mechanism of preventing prior mental exertion (e.g., mental fatigue and ego depletion). Future studies could examine more on the duration of the intervention."}

The brain is the most complex biological system that exists. Timbre, in its very nature, is a multidimensional concept with several levels of abstraction thus rendering the investigation of its processing in the brain extremely challenging. Timbre processing can be discussed in relation to levels of abstraction. Low- to mid-level representations can be associated with the neural representation of acoustic structure while high-level abstractions correspond to the neural representation of sound source properties. Furthermore, neural correlates of timbre can be broadly classified based on three stimulus categories, that is, those pertaining to music, speech, and environmental sounds. This chapter summarizes studies that have attempted to uncover neural correlates of varying levels of timbre abstractions. Finally, developments in methodological approaches are described, including the shift from univariate to multivariate statistical models, the employment of more naturalistic stimuli, and brain measurement paradigms from hitherto controlled auditory paradigms."}

In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of smart devices connect, interact, and exchange data with each other. As \u201cthings\u201d get connected together, intelligent systems and technologies have been developed to exploit the rich information in the collected data, perceive what is happening in the surroundings, and finally take actions to maximize their own utility. Thanks to the ubiquitous wireless signals and the prevalence of wireless devices, wireless sensing becomes more popular among the various approaches that have been adopted in the IoT to measure the surrounding environment. Because human activities interact with wireless signals and introduce distinct patterns to the propagation, analyzing how wireless channel state information (CSI) responds to human activities enables many IoT applications. Recently, radio analytics has been proposed as a promising technique that exploits multipath as virtual antennas, extracts various features from wireless signals, and reveals rich environmental information. As automobiles continue to play an important role nowadays, manufacturers have been seeking emerging techniques for IoT applications that support drivers and enhance safety. The interior of an automobile can be viewed as a special indoor environment where most of the multipaths are restricted inside by the metal exterior. In this article, we introduce the concept of wireless artificial intelligence (AI) and demonstrate its concept in a smart car scenario where information about drivers and passengers is collected by commercial Wi-Fi devices deployed in the car. The proposed wireless AI system is capable of identifying authorized drivers based on radio biometric information. Vital signals of human introduce periodic patterns to the wireless CSI. By extracting the vital sign from wireless signals, the proposed wireless AI system can monitor the driver's state, count number of people in the car, and detect a child left in an unattended car."}

Abstract Background Unintended pregnancies (UIP) have a significant impact on health of women and the health budget of countries. Contraception is an effective way to prevent UIPs. The study objective was to collate evidence on clinical effectiveness of etonogestrel subdermal implant (ESI), continuation rate and side effect profile among eligible women of reproductive age group, as compared to levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) and depot medroxy progesterone acetate injections; other types of contraceptive implants were excluded as comparators. Methods The protocol of the systematic review was registered in Prospero (registration number: CRD42018116580). MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane library and web of science were the electronic databases searched. A search strategy was formulated and studies from 1998 to 2019 were included. Clinical trial registries and grey literature search was done. Critical assessment of included studies was done using appropriate tools. A qualitative synthesis of included studies was done and a meta-analysis was conducted in RevMan software for continuation rates of ESI as compared to other long acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) e.g. LNG IUS and Cu-IUD. Results The search yielded 23,545 studies. After excluding 467 duplicates, 23,078 titles were screened and 51 studies were included for the review. Eight of the 15 studies reporting clinical effectiveness reported 100% effectiveness and overall pearl index ranged from 0 to 1.4. One-year continuation rates ranged from 57\u201397%; 44\u201395% at the end of second year and 25\u201378% by 3 years of use. Abnormal menstruation was the most commonly reported side effect. There was no significant difference in bone mineral density at 1 year follow-up. The meta-analyses showed that odds ratio (OR) of 1-year continuation rate was 1.55 (1.36, 1.76) for LNG-IUS vs. ESI and 1.34 (1.13, 1.58) for copper-IUD vs. ESI; showing that continuation rates at the end of one-year were higher in LNG-IUS and copper-IUD as compared to ESI. Conclusion ESI is clinically effective and safe contraceptive method to use, yet 1-year continuation rates are lower as compared to LNG-IUS and copper-IUD, mostly attributed to the disturbances in the menstruation."}

Exposure to green space has beneficial effects on several cognitive and behavioral aspects. However, to our knowledge, no study addressed intelligence as outcome. We investigated whether the level of urbanicity can modify the association of residential green space with intelligence and behavior in children.This study includes 620 children and is part of the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey (EFPTS), a registry of multiple births in the province of East Flanders, Belgium. Intelligence was assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) in 620 children (310 twin pairs) between 7 and 15 years old. From a subset of 442 children, behavior was determined based on the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Prenatal and childhood residential addresses were geocoded and used to assign green space indicators. Mixed modeling was performed to investigate green space in association with intelligence and behavior while adjusting for potential confounding factors including sex, age, parental education, neighborhood household income, year of assessment, and zygosity and chorionicity. We found that residential green space in association with both intelligence and behavior in children was modified by the degree of urbanicity (p < 0.001). In children living in an urban environment, multivariable adjusted mixed modeling analysis revealed that an IQR increment of residential green space (3,000-m radius) was associated with a 2.6 points (95% CI 1.4-3.9; p < 0.001) higher total intelligence quotient (IQ) and 2.0 points (95% CI -3.5 to -0.4; p = 0.017) lower externalizing behavioral score. In children residing in a rural or suburban environment, no association was found. A limitation of this study is that no information was available on school location and the potential for unmeasured confounding (e.g., time spend outdoors).Our results indicate that residential green space may be beneficial for the intellectual and the behavioral development of children living in urban areas. These findings are relevant for policy makers and urban planners to create an optimal environment for children to develop their full potential."}

There is strong evidence that chronic, systemic inflammation hastens onset of the diseases of old age that ultimately lead to death. Importantly, several studies suggest that childhood adversity predicts chronic inflammation. Unfortunately, this research has been plagued by retrospective reports of childhood adversity, an absence of controls for adult stressors, and a failure to investigate various competing models of the link between childhood adversity and chronic inflammation. The present study was designed to address these limitations. Using 18 years of data collected from 413 African Americans (58% female) included in the Family and Community Health Study, hierarchical regression analyses provided support for a nuanced early life sensitivity explanation for the link between early adversity and adult chronic inflammation. Controlling for health risk behaviors and adult SES, late childhood (ages 10-12) adversity amplified the association between adult adversity (age 29) and chronic inflammation. This interaction operated in a domain-specific fashion. Harsh parenting amplified the relation between intimate partner hostility and inflammation, whereas early discrimination amplified the relation between adult discrimination and inflammation. These findings suggest that individuals may be primed to respond physiologically to adverse adult circumstances that resemble those experienced earlier in life."}

Background The economic evaluation of health interventions is important in priority setting. Several guidance documents exist to support the conduct of economic evaluations, however, there is limited guidance for the evaluation of non-medical interventions. For tuberculosis (TB), where equity-deserving groups are disproportionately impacted, assessing interventions aimed at addressing social risk factors is necessary to effectively reduce TB burden. Objective This scoping review seeks to assess the existing literature on model-based economic evaluations of TB interventions to gauge the extent to which non-medical interventions have been evaluated in low-TB-incidence jurisdictions. As a secondary objective, this review aims to characterize key features of existing economic evaluations of medical and non-medical interventions. Methods A literature search was conducted in the grey literature and MEDLINE, Embase, EconLit, and PsychINFO databases to September 6, 2022 following the Arksey and O\u2019Malley framework. Eligible articles were those that used decision-analytic modeling for economic evaluation of TB interventions in low-TB-incidence jurisdictions. Results This review identified 127 studies that met the inclusion criteria; 11 focused on prevention, 73 on detection, and 43 on treatment of TB. Only three studies (2%) evaluated non-medical interventions, including smoking reduction strategies, improving housing conditions, and providing food vouchers. All three non-medical intervention evaluations incorporated TB transmission and robust uncertainty analysis into the evaluation. The remainder of the studies evaluated direct medical interventions, eight of which were focused on specific implementation components (e.g., video observed therapy) which shared similar methodological challenges as the non-medical interventions. The majority of remaining evaluated medical interventions were focused on comparing various screening programs (e.g., immigrant screening program) and treatment regimens. Conclusions This scoping review identified a gap in literature in the evaluation of non-medical TB interventions. However, the identified articles provided useful examples of how economic modeling can be used to explore non-traditional interventions using existing economic evaluation methods."}

This study design, with two ART groups and a subfertile reference group, allows for disentangling the effects of OS and ART procedures on developmental outcome. Cognitive outcome was evaluated with the Wechsler abbreviated scale of intelligence and the NEPSY-II. Behaviour was assessed with the child behaviour checklist (CBCL) and teacher report form (TRF). Univariable analyses and multiple linear regression models were used.There was no significant difference in intelligence quotient (IQ) scores between ART groups (mean IQ (95% CI): OS 114.8 (83.2-142.6); MNC 114.0 (90.2-140.8); Sub-NC 115.4 (87.9-141.2), P = 0.746). Multivariable analyses did not reveal a statistically significant association between ART group and total, verbal and performance IQ. CBCL and TRF scores did not differ significantly between ART groups (P = 0.090 and 0.507, respectively). Multivariable analyses did not demonstrate a statistically significant association between ART group and CBCL and TRF total, or internalising and externalising T-scores. No significant correlations between time to pregnancy (TTP)-a proxy for the severity of parental subfertility-and outcome measures were found (Spearman rho between -0.050 and 0.049, NS), which was confirmed with multivariable analyses.The attrition rate of 21% may be considered as a limitation of the study; however, after a follow-up period of 9 years, this rate is generally considered acceptable, and there were no significant differences in background characteristics between children with and without follow-up, making an attrition-related selection bias less likely. Another limitation of the study is the relatively small sample size, which could contribute to selection bias, hamper generalizability to the ART population and lead to false negative findings as a result of underpowering. An a priori power analysis on total IQ indicated that the OS-IVF\/ICSI and Sub-NC groups should contain 64 children, confirming that our study including 57 and 66 children, respectively, was slightly underpowered.Our study indicated that OS and the in vitro laboratory procedures or the combination of both and TTP were not associated with cognitive and behavioural outcome at 9 years. These are reassuring results for both parents and clinicians involved in ART.The study was financially supported by the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), two graduate schools of the UMCG (BCN and SHARE) and the Cornelia Stichting.

In recent decades, the automatic recognition and interpretation of brain waves acquired by electroencephalographic (EEG) technologies have undergone remarkable growth, leading to a consequent rapid development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). EEG-based BCIs are non-invasive systems that allow communication between a human being and an external device interpreting brain activity directly. Thanks to the advances in neurotechnologies, and especially in the field of wearable devices, BCIs are now also employed outside medical and clinical applications. Within this context, this paper proposes a systematic review of EEG-based BCIs, focusing on one of the most promising paradigms based on motor imagery (MI) and limiting the analysis to applications that adopt wearable devices. This review aims to evaluate the maturity levels of these systems, both from the technological and computational points of view. The selection of papers has been performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), leading to 84 publications considered in the last ten years (from 2012 to 2022).

In order to investigate social learning with multiple true states, a social learning model with time-varying topology and reliance weight is proposed.

Simultaneously, the adaptive time-varying reliance weight mechanism is designed according to the closeness degree of agents\u2019 neighbors. The simulation results show that asymptotic learning can be achieved and communities emerge under certain parameter values.

DSM-V based psychiatric interview (PI) was done by a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Eight of 30 children who underwent PI were within the high-risk group (HRG), and 4 of these children were diagnosed with DMMD (0.88% of the total sample). There was at least one comorbid diagnosis in all four children diagnosed with DMMD. Our study is one of the few studies evaluating the frequency of DMMD in Turkey. Although the prevalence of DMMD is low, comorbid diagnosis rates require detailed examination and multifaceted perspectives in the follow-up and treatment process."}

This interwoven history makes it a worthwhile object of study, but it has also resulted in studies that are either decidedly broad, very specific, or that focus exclusively on one kind of garden at the expense of the other. This thesis seeks to address these obstacles by challenging the line between real gardens and their images. Applying a novel working definition of \u201cform\u201d, I argue that the constituent forms of real gardens can be conceptualised as a set of meaning-bearing resources which enable, when represented, kinds of figurative meanings. This thesis considers the real garden as reducible to three forms essential to all gardens: enclosure, internal arrangement, and cultivation by a gardener. Such a distillation allows us to interrogate persistent meanings of the garden image across literatures by fixing it as an object of inquiry. These three forms, I argue, enable political meanings, figuring the relationship of individuals to greater systems or wholes, their arrangement of elements, and dramatising the operation and limits of power. However, those forms have been emphasised, represented, and ultimately signified differently in images of various provenance and in various writers\u2019 hands. &lt;\/b&gt;&lt;\/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My chapters trace the garden\u2019s persistent forms across time and place. Two of my chapters address Civil War England. The first considers how gardens respond to a specific discursive context to imagine a dystopian state in Andrew Marvell\u2019s \u201cThe Mower against Gardens\u201d and the potential for utopian change in \u201cThe Garden\u201d. In my second chapter, I turn to Lucy Hutchinson\u2019s \u201cElegies\u201d, considering how her poetic garden operates within the elegy and country house genres and responds to literary precedents like Marvell\u2019s \u201cUpon Appleton House\u201d to characterise a grief that is intractably personal and political. My final two chapters shift in time and place to consider twentieth- and twenty-first-century New Zealand poetry, analysing in the third chapter the turn away from colonial settler verse in Ursula Bethell\u2019s poetry towards the domestic garden as a site of home and belonging. Finally, my last chapter considers Jenny Bornholdt\u2019s contemporary New Zealand verse, in which the garden image dramatises the power imbalance and artifice intrinsic to poetry itself. This thesis therefore seeks to produce general knowledge about how the garden, through its forms, can mean, while also producing specific knowledge about how garden images have meant in particular texts across different contexts. I argue that these are not contrary aims: a new approach to the garden as a set of forms proves an incisive tool with which to understand this important and variegated image.&lt;\/p&gt;"}

Manufacturing firms have been compelled to invest heavily in digitizing and optimizing their technical and manufacturing operations as a result of mass customization. When developing and introducing new goods, not only must manufacturing procedures be computerized, but also information of how the products must be developed and manufactured based on client needs must be applied. One major academic issue is to assist the industry in ensuring that stakeholders understand the background information of automated engineering all through the production process. The goal of the study described in this article is to provide a foundation for a connectivity perspective of Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE). The use of graph theory in conjunction with content-based filtering methods is used to handle network creation and contextualization, which are fundamental ideas in connectivism. To enable a connectivity management culture, the article demonstrates how engineering information in spreadsheet, knowledge representation, and Computer Aided Design (CAD) models may be infiltrated and displayed as filtering graphs."}

Collateral work with parents is a widely adopted practice within child psychotherapy. Therapeutic process within these parent sessions has not been empirically studied or defined, despite a sizable process-outcome literature in both child and adult individual therapy. This link between research and practice is particularly important among manualized, child-focused treatments, where the proposed therapeutic action and clinical approach to parent work is defined according to distinct theoretical principles. To address this gap in the child treatment literature, the present study used the Psychotherapy Process Q Set to examine the in-session processes of parent sessions from 16 treatments of regulation-focused psychotherapy for children (RFP-C). RFP-C is a manualized, psychodynamic treatment for children with disruptive behaviors that consists of 16 child sessions and four collateral parent sessions. The parent-session process ratings were compared to existing adult therapy prototypes and the RFP-C child session prototype. Results indicated that observer-coded psychotherapy process in RFP-C parent sessions was most similar to a cognitive-behavioral therapy prototype and moderately correlated with both a supportive-expressive psychodynamic psychotherapy and a reflective functioning prototype. Observer-coded parent session process was distinct from the RFP-C child prototype. Limitations and directions for future research and clinical practice are discussed. The findings of this study indicate the need to intentionally examine process in parent sessions, both within RFP-C and across modalities, as these sessions have their own unique mechanisms of therapeutic action that ultimately may be additive with regard to child outcomes.

There is a paradigm shift in the conventional approach to issues in all facets of endeavour as result of the emergent of Information communication and technology. Functional and effective education may be grossly impossible in the 21 st  century without the use of ICT.\u00a0 Childhood education teachers are saddled with the responsibility of implementing the childhood curricular meant to prepare pupils and students of childhood age for subsequent levels of education. For this level of education to be at par with the contemporary global approach, it demands adequate possession of ICT skills.. In view of this background, the study aimed at ascertaining the impact of experience and gender on the extent to which childhood education teachers possess ICT skills, with emphasis to ICT skills that promote effective childhood curricular implementation. The study adopted ex post facto designs. Five research questions and two hypotheses guided the study. A sample size of 2130 childhood education teachers (pre-basic, lower basic and upper basic) education teachers drawn from 213 childhood education schools in Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja were used for the study. Mean and standard deviation was used to answer the research questions while t-test was employed to test the hypotheses. The result of the study showed that the extent to which childhood education teachers possess ICT skills for effective implementation of childhood education curricular waste a great extent; gender and experience were significant factors on the extent childhood education teachers\u2019 possess ICT skills.

In a recent, subsequent study, Pan et al. consider the potential of the same technology in the realm of child protection training and safeguarding issues (2). To build upon the Pan et al. (2) study, a panel discussion was held at The Centre for Behavior Change Annual Conference 2018 to discuss the question \"Can a virtual reality communication scenario be used to teach General Practitioners and trainees how to recognize and manage child protection issues?.\" Methodology: The above study comprised an immersive virtual reality consultation, in which the ability of 63 doctors to pick up covert safeguarding cues was tested in the context of a consultation with an adult patient, where the patient's child happened to be present as well. The study and its findings were discussed at the Centre for Behavior Change 4th Annual Conference, and this paper summarizes the opinions of both the panel and the audience. Viewpoint: Safeguarding is a challenging area of practice where we must listen to the child, and tackle difficult conversations with parents. Within medical training, role play is the gold standard for teaching how to communicate in difficult scenarios. Given the ethical questions surrounding children being asked to role play such abuse, the use of virtual reality characters could have a key role in upgrading current practices in medical education on safeguarding."}

In Canada, two of the most common forms of maltreatment substantiated by child protective services are child exposure to domestic violence and child physical abuse. Fathers are identified as the parent responsible for a substantial proportion of this maltreatment.This study examined whether providing a group-based intervention program for fathers was associated with greater engagement of fathers in child protection case management and with lower rates of subsequent father-perpetrated abuse.A quasi-experimental design compared child protection outcomes in families in which fathers were referred to an intervention program (Caring Dads) and either completed the group (n = 85) or remained on a waitlist for future service (n = 100).Data were collected from a retrospective review of administrative files over two years, starting from the time of referral to Caring Dads.Initial comparisons found no significant differences in intervention and comparison group fathers in demographic characteristics, child protection concerns, and all but one area of risk and needs. Completing intervention, as compared to being waitlisted, was associated with a greater number of contacts between child protection workers and fathers over two years (M = 30.3 vs. M = 16.7), a difference that was significant and large in size (d = 0.81) and with lower rates of verified re-referral due to fathers' maltreatment (20.5% vs. 36.0%), a difference that was significant and between small and medium in size (V = 0.17).Current results suggest that there may be significant benefits of involving fathers in child protection-linked intervention."}

The geographical differences that cause anaemia can be partially explained by the variability in environmental factors, particularly nutrition and infections. The studies failed to explain the non-linear effect of the continuous covariates on childhood anaemia. The present paper aims to investigate the risk factors of childhood anaemia in India with focus on geographical spatial effect.Geo-additive logistic regression models were fitted to the data to understand fixed as well as spatial effects of childhood anaemia. Logistic regression was fitted for the categorical variable with outcomes (anaemia (Hb < 11) and no anaemia (Hb \u2265 11)). Continuous covariates were modelled by the penalized spline and spatial effects were smoothed by the two-dimensional spline.At 95% posterior credible interval, the influence of unobserved factors on childhood anaemia is very strong in the Northern and Central part of India. However, most of the states in North Eastern part of India showed negative spatial effects. A U-shape non-linear relationship was observed between childhood anaemia and mother's age. This indicates that mothers of young and old ages are more likely to have anaemic children; in particular mothers aged 15 years to about 25 years. Then the risk of childhood anaemia starts declining after the age of 25 years and it continues till the age of around 37 years, thereafter again starts increasing. Further, the non-linear effects of duration of breastfeeding on childhood anaemia show that the risk of childhood anaemia decreases till 29 months thereafter increases.Strong evidence of residual spatial effect to childhood anaemia in India is observed. Government child health programme should gear up in treating childhood anaemia by focusing on known measurable factors such as mother's education, mother's anaemia status, family wealth status, child health (fever), stunting, underweight, and wasting which have been found to be significant in this study. Attention should also be given to effects of unknown or unmeasured factors to childhood anaemia at the community level. Special attention to unmeasurable factors should be focused in the states of central and northern India which have shown significant positive spatial effects."}

This type of research is Doctrinal research, with the Statute Approach, Conceptual Approach, and Case Approach. The results of the study revealed that the involvement of children in productive activities was constrained by the labor market in the formal sector which was very limited. Therefore, when children are in search of work and income, they will only do the easy work of prostitution. Related to sexual exploitation in prostitution activities, not only child victim is given protection, but child offender must also be protected. From the perspective of criminal law in Indonesia, regulations related to prostitution activities are contained in the Criminal Code (KUHP). This is based on the main purpose of protecting children to realize the welfare of children by providing guarantees for the fulfillment of children's rights without discriminatory treatment.

BACKGROUND:The potential mechanisms underlying premature rupture of membrane (PROM) is still unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the role of Keap-1\/Nrf2 signaling pathway activation by oxidative stress in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes. MATERIAL AND METHODS:Placental tissues from preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) (n=20), full-term premature rupture of membranes (FPROM) (n=20), and normal-term births (n=20) were collected and amniotic tissues were separated from the placental tissues from pregnant women at Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the levels of factors in the Keap-1\/Nrf2 signaling pathway. To investigate the roles of Nrf2, we downregulated Nrf2 expression using siRNA in primary human amniotic epithelial (HAE) cells. RESULTS:Among the control group, FPROM group, and PPROM group, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were significantly increased in the FPROM and PPROM groups. The differences indicated higher levels of oxidative stress in amniotic tissues with FPROM and PPROM after downregulation of si-Nrf2 in HAE cells. Antioxidants were lower in amniotic tissues with the FPROM group and PPROM group than in the control group. The antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), and superoxide dismutases (SOD1 and SOD2) were examined in amniotic tissues. We found that the ROS levels were significantly increased after downregulation of si-Nrf2 compared with the control group. We found that the expression of Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), which is critical in the Keap-1\/Nrf2 signaling pathway, increased significantly after downregulation of si-Nrf2 in HAE cells. CONCLUSIONS:We found that increased ROS levels and decreased antioxidant enzymes in the PPROM and FPROM patients compared with the control group."}

Abstract Introduction Based on the schema theory advanced by Rumelhart and Norman, we shed light on the individual variability in brain dynamics induced by hybridization of learning methodologies, particularly alternating unsupervised learning and supervised learning in language acquisition. The concept of \u201cschema\u201d implies a latent knowledge structure that a learner holds and updates as intrinsic to his or her cognitive space for guiding the processing of newly arriving information. Methods We replicated the cognitive experiment of Onnis and Thiessen on implicit statistical learning ability in language acquisition but included additional factors of prosodic variables and explicit supervised learning. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed to identify the functional network connections for schema updating by alternately using unsupervised and supervised artificial grammar learning tasks to segment potential words. Results Regardless of the quality of task performance, the default mode network represented the first stage of spontaneous unsupervised learning, and the wrap\u2010up accomplishment for successful subjects of the whole hybrid learning in concurrence with the task\u2010related auditory language networks.

Background: As a response to the spread of the coronavirus in Germany, day care centres and schools closed nationwide, leaving families to grapple with additional child care tasks. In Germany, as in many other societies, women shoulder the lion\u2019s share of housework and child care responsibilities. While the gendered division of household labour has shifted in recent years as men have become more engaged in the upbringing of their children, it was hypothesised that the coronavirus crisis may have resulted in a re-traditionalisation of behaviour. This paper examines this hypothesis by analysing how the time fathers spent with their children changed over the course of the coronavirus crisis in the case of Germany. Methods: Data for this investigation come from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP). The outcome variable is the time spent on child care tasks. We investigate how the time parents spent with their children changed between 2019 and spring 2020, and how these patterns differed by gender, education, and employment situation. As a method, we employ linear panel regressions where the dependent variable is the change in childcare time between the two survey years.Results: We find that fathers and mothers expanded the time they spent on child care to similar degrees between 2019 and spring 2020, which marks the climax of the coronavirus crisis. However, we also observe large differences by level of education. In particular, we find that men with low and medium levels of education spent more time with their children than they did before the onset of the crisis. This finding is at odds with the results of prior studies on fathers\u2019 involvement, which showed that highly educated men tend to be the vanguards of paternal involvement. Contribution: Our study provides novel evidence on the effect of the coronavirus crisis on fathers\u2019 involvement in child care. Contrary to expectations based on previous research, we find that fathers significantly expanded the time they were spending with their children over the course of the crisis. While we also find that women continue to perform the bulk of child care tasks, our results cast a positive light on the potential of paternal involvement in contemporary societies."}

According to the associative theory of learning, reactive behaviors described by stimulus-response pairs result in the progressive wiring of a plastic brain. In contrast, flexible behaviors are supposedly driven by neurologically grounded mental states that involve computations on informational contents. These theories appear complementary, but are generally opposed to each other. The former is favored by neuro-scientists who explore the low-level biological processes supporting cognition, and the later by cognitive psychologists who look for higher-level structures. This situation can be clarified through an analysis that independently defines abstract neurological and informational functionalities, and then relate them through a virtual interface. This framework is validated through a modeling of the first stage of Piaget's cognitive development theory, whose reported end experiments demonstrate the emergence of mental representations of object displacements. The neural correlates grounding this emergence are given in the isomorphic format of an associative memory. As a child's exploration of the world progresses, his mental models will eventually include representations of space, time and causality. Only then epistemological concepts, such as beliefs, will give rise to higher level mental representations in a possibly richer propositional format. This raises the question of which additional neurological functionalities, if any, would be required in order to include these extensions into a comprehensive grounded model. We relay previously expressed views, which in summary hypothesize that the ability to learn has evolved from associative reflexes and memories, to suggest that the functionality of associative memories could well provide the sufficient means for grounding cognitive capacities."}

OVOP has established about 2300 centers in ten provinces, enrolling over 170,000 3\u20136-year olds, free of charge for all. We analyzed longitudinal data collected from a sample of 1962 children in Ledu county of Qinghai Province (comparing OVOP attendees to children who had experienced no ECE, private ECE, or public ECE), using an inverse probability weighted longitudinal growth modeling approach to reduce selection bias in evaluating the effects of OVOP on children\u2019s academic achievement during the first 5 years of elementary school. We found that children who attended OVOP centers attained higher scores in elementary grades than children who had received no ECE or who had attended private township ECE. However, OVOP children scored lower than children who went to well-resourced public township ECE centers, despite showing growth rates that were similar. Both OVOP and public ECE groups improved more quickly than children in the no-ECE or private-ECE group.

In Kenya, millions of children have limited access to nurturing care. With the COVID-19 pandemic, it is anticipated that vulnerable children will bear the biggest brunt of the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic. This review aimed to deepen understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on nurturing care from conception to four years of age, a period where the care of children is often delivered through caregivers or other informal platforms. The review has drawn upon the empirical evidence from previous pandemics and epidemics, and anecdotal and emerging evidence from the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Multifactorial impacts fall into five key domains: direct health; health and nutrition systems, economic, social and child protection, and child development and early learning. The review proposes program and policy strategies to guide the re-orientation of nurturing care, prevent the detrimental effects associated with deteriorating nurturing care environments, and support the optimal development of the youngest and most vulnerable children. These include the provision of cash transfers and essential supplies for vulnerable households, and strengthening of community-based platforms for nurturing care. Further research on COVID-19 and the ability of children&amp;rsquo;s ecology to provide nurturing care is needed, as is further testing of new ideas."}

Previous research in the U.S. using predominantly English-speaking, low-risk samples suggests that firstborns tend to show better early cognitive and school readiness skills than later-born children. However, results of the current study showed that although there was a firstborn advantage in low-risk or English-speaking families, in high-risk or language minority families, later-born children showed equivalent or even better skills than firstborn children.

Abstract Objectives New Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) meal patterns and best-practices were implemented nationally in 2017 to address the need to prevent chronic diseases. Young Native American children have disproportionately higher risk of chronic disease. Some Native American tribes operate early care and education (ECE) programs and have the opportunity to participate in the CACFP. The purpose of this paper is to describe a CACFP best-practice menu and training developed and implemented as part of the Food Resource Equity and Sustainability for Health (FRESH) study. Methods FRESH is a community-based participatory research (CBPR) intervention implemented within ECE programs in the Osage Nation of Oklahoma. Site managers and cooks from each of the nine ECE programs attended meetings and provided feedback to investigators which shaped the best-practice menu and training. Each site participated in a three-hour training in January 2018 to discuss the best-practice menu and ways to overcome implementation barriers. Goals of the menu aimed to increase intake of fruit and vegetables and whole grains and reduce pre-fried and processed foods without increasing cook burden. Training included application activities individually and in small and large groups. Results Though the project is still underway, lessons learned have emerged including the need for technical assistance, improved communication between ECE program staff and food supply vendors, and infrastructure barriers (e.g., limited space, lack of supplies) that challenge work-flow. Conclusions Efforts to improve menus in rural and low-income ECE programs must consider these issues in developing feasible intervention strategies. Collaboration with the site manager and cook is essential to fully understand perceived and actual barriers to provide training that can provide necessary background rationale for nutrition recommendations as well as beneficial and productive activities and hands-on training to effect change outside the training.

A literature review of research papers from online *** libraries by the author found that only a small percentage of children met the recommended guidelines resulting in the risk of language disorders, delayed development of physical, motor skills and cognitive abilities, obesity, sleep problems, depression and anxiety due to screen exposure. The loneliness of children is found to be the primary reason for the excessive screen time. The author suggests that counsellors help parents look beyond limiting a child\u2019s screen time alone and improve the parental attitude toward the child\u2019s behaviour which is the biggest barrier in managing a child\u2019s screen time. The author\u2019s contribution is the \u2018SALT\u2019 counselling approach emphasising listening Support, finding Alternatives, Loneliness and Time in this digital era to cater to all types of child learners - visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Why is your paper of interest to readers? Exposure of preschool children to digital devices is more than double the recommended screen time, hampering a child\u2019s critical personality development required as per Erik Erikson\u2019s Theory. Counsellors need to look at other associated factors beyond screen time which affect children adversely and which are more important than just the screen time limitation prescribed as per government guidelines. Focus: SE Asia and Outside SE Asia (No IRB approval is sought as the paper is based on secondary research.)"}

Child protection has become a very poignant subject in the UK. The Laming report into the death of Victoria Climbi\u00e9 led to the implementation of multidisciplinary safeguarding policies and training for healthcare professionals, social services staff and police. However, many dental practitioners, as well as other healthcare professionals, have little confidence when reporting their concerns and reducing the \u2018gap\u2019 between suspicion and reporting (Laming in The victoria climbie inquiry: report of an inquiry by Lord Laming, 2003. https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/publications\/the-victoria-climbie-inquiry-report-of-an-inquiry-by-lord-laming ). Our audit aimed to identify and address the barriers of reporting safeguarding concerns amongst the hospital team. Questionnaires were distributed to staff at Surrey and Sussex Healthcare National Health Service Trust with a valid Safeguarding Children Level 3 certificate in order to assess their knowledge of safeguarding children. Changes to traditional safeguarding training (Group 1) were implemented to include a broader range of speakers, each speaking for shorter times with more personal and focused presentations (Groups 2 and 3). Three cohorts of participants were assessed including healthcare assistants, nurses, dentists, and doctors. Group 1 (n = 100) reported 64% experience of reporting compared with group 2 (n = 100) 43% and group 3 (n = 76) 51%. Confidence was higher in those with more experience in child protection. The most common barrier was the uncertainty of diagnosis. More barriers to reporting existed in the new style of training in groups 2 and 3. The scenarios were answered with appropriate concern and reporting by groups 1 and 2, however, less for group 3. Experienced and trained practitioners are more likely to refer children to child protection teams when they have concerns of abuse or neglect. Personalising training was shown to be less effective and the focus should be more on diagnosis and local protocols. Early training from undergraduate level was a unanimous request. Focused training on diagnosis and local protocols, accompanied by bespoke teaching for specific specialties would be the most constructive tool for safeguarding children. Exploring modern methods such as simulation-based training could be effective. Structured forms and local policies that are familiar to clinicians prevent omissions and encourage professional awareness."}

By focusing on a period of a major public childcare expansion in Germany, this study investigates whether higher levels of childcare coverage for under-threes have been positively associated with employment among mothers with different educational backgrounds. Both standard economic labour theories and sociological theories presume that the effect of public childcare provision varies with mothers\u2019 educational attainment. The analysis links county-level data on annual childcare ratios with individual-level data from the Socio-Economic Panel Study (2007-2016). To match mothers with similar characteristics in counties with childcare ratios above and below the annual median within East and West Germany, entropy balancing is applied. Findings indicate a positive relationship between childcare provision and maternal employment, with more pronounced associations for mothers with at least a vocational degree, those with a second birth, and those who receive full-time access to childcare."}

This study is about the inclusion of play in early childhood school settings, the contested nature of curricula that are not strictly quantifiable, and the ways that institutional inequity influences children\u2019s access to school-based play. It is situated in a public elementary school kindergarten that centered play in the curriculum with varying degrees of support from a range of stakeholders. This ethnographic phenomenological case study depended on data collection methods of observational field notes and participant interviews, and grounded theory methods were employed for analysis. Findings were that teachers and administrators need clearer understandings of play and its integral connection to early literacy practices so they are valued and implemented in early childhood settings. Additionally, the voices of marginalized student populations and their families are excluded from institutional decision-making processes, which has the effect of silencing or controlling their participation in educational opportunities."}

The main aim of this study was to investigate how large class size and teacher-to-learner ratio affect classroom management in early childhood educational centres in Ghana. A descriptive survey was used as research design for the study, which was underpinned by positivist philosophical thought. The data was collected using a four-point Likert-type scale questionnaire, to be administered to preschool teachers and head teachers. The sample size for the study was 216 participants and the data was analysed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), mean and standard deviation. It was found that the presence of teacher-to-learner ratio (TLR) in early childhood education centres (ECECs) resulted in poor interaction and communication between preschool teachers and pre-schoolers, which had an effect on teachers\u2019 classroom management. Moreover, in large classes, where teachers are unable to perform effective classroom management, classroom discipline and engagement will be more difficult to achieve than in the smaller classes. Again, the findings revealed that in cases of large class size, preschool teachers were repeating activities and were unable to attend to two events simultaneously in the classroom without having their attention diverted unduly by disruptions. The study also pointed out that positive reinforcement, shaping, giving prompt feedback and giving clear instructions were effective classroom strategies used in managing pre-schoolers in classes of larger size."}
