      "Planning and Optimization During the Life-Cycle of Service Level Agreements for Cloud Computing. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an electronic contract between the consumer and the provider of a service. It governs their business relationship by clarifying expectations and obligations of participating entities, with regard to the service and its quality. SLAs are already the prime paradigm for the description of cloud computing services. Once an SLA is established, the provider has to ensure that service quality remains within certain acceptable levels; and comply with the customer's demands until the end of the service life time. However, managing the SLAs is still a technical challenge that requires signi cant e ort to achieve autonomy, economy and e ciency. Current state-of-the-art in SLA management faces challenges such as SLA representation for cloud services; business-related SLA optimizations; service outsourcing and resource management. These areas constitute, as one would expect, major contemporary research topics. Hence, a structured methodology engineered for the management of the di erent phases of SLAs during its lifespan is of paramount importance, which indeed facilitates the realization of the cloud SLA management. To this aim, I present diversi ed models and approaches in SLA lifecycle management that address the aforementioned challenges and enable automatic service modeling, negotiation, provisioning and monitoring. During the SLA creation phase, I outline how to improve and simplify the structures that model SLAs. Furthermore, another objective of my approach is to minimize implementation and outsourcing costs for reasons of competitiveness, while respecting business policies for pro t and risk. During the SLA monitoring phase, I develop the strategies for virtual cloud resources selection and allocation during live migrations. Then, I apply an appropriate theoretical model for ne-grained yet simpli ed and practical monitoring of massive sets of SLAs, that separates the agreement's fault-tolerance concerns into multiple autonomous layers. The work at hand contributes a blueprint for the GWDG and its scienti c communities. The research that lead to this thesis was conducted as part of the SLA@SOI EU/FP7 Integrated Project (contract No. 216556).\n",
      "We Belong to No Soil: Nation and Narration in the Work of Emily Perkins. &lt;p&gt;Emily Perkins' work exemplifies a shift in the way the nation is represented in New Zealand fiction. In place of the cultural nationalist acceptance that the writer should attend faithfully to the New Zealand referent and seek to define the nation we find doubt, uncertainty and resistance. This shift has been observed positively in some contemporary criticism, notably in Anna Jackson and Jane Stafford's Floating Worlds (2009). But other commentary, such as Patrick Evans' 2003 'Spectacular Babies' essay, is highly negative. There is a surprisingly small amount of critical attention dedicated to contemporary New Zealand writing. This thesis will offer some reasons for this lack of commentary and propose a framework within which Perkins' work can be analysed. It will also identify the ways in which Perkins' work refers to the nation and how this differs from the way in which the cultural nationalists referred to the nation. I argue that new critical modes are required to approach contemporary New Zealand writers like Perkins that reach behind the cultural nationalist influence. Accordingly, I position Perkins' way of representing New Zealandness alongside that of early writers Benjamin Farjeon and Katherine Mansfield, to show that a non-essentialised identity can be expressed in the text. The contemporary approach to this endeavour can be compared to what I call \"pre-nationalist\" writing, although early avoidances of the New Zealand referent were not as deliberate as they now are. I argue that like Katherine Mansfield, Perkins' textual relationship with New Zealand is metonymic rather than referential. Her writing conjures up New Zealand without generalising it or essentialising it. In this thesis, I address three of the primary ways that Perkins achieves this in her writing. Firstly, she addresses the meaning of place and its significance in the formation of subjectivity. Secondly, she deliberately avoids taking an overt political stance and use of the Māori referent. The absences in her work contrast with detailed attention to what is there, and so appear as a presence. In this sense her work depends largely on how the reader is able to interpret the absences and provide what is unsaid. Thirdly, her attention to New Zealandisms, linguistic idiosyncrasies and her use of taboo language refer to New Zealandness but simultaneously reveal self-consciousness. I argue that the diagnosis of New Zealand identity as 'floating', while useful, is problematic because it tends to have a silencing effect on discussions of contemporary literature. Characterising New Zealand identity as 'floating' appears to signal the end of the conversation and to assume that because the literature cannot be categorised, it cannot be discussed either. This thesis will suggest alternative ways of addressing New Zealandness which open up, rather than close, new possible perspectives on contemporary New Zealand literature.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "Towards an integrated methodology : C4, Sherr and Dream provings of Protea cynaroides. Homoeopathic provings form the experimental base of clinical homoeopathy. Provings are conducted through the administration of homoeopathically prepared medicine to healthy volunteers in order to elicit disease symptoms. The symptoms are collated to formulate the materia medica of the substance. AIM The aim of this study was to compare the most commonly employed proving methodologies, the C4 trituration, the Sherr and the Dream proving methodology, by application in order to ascertain the validity of the claims made in terms of the efficiency of the method to elicit reproducible symptoms. This study sought to follow the existing methodologies exactly as set out by the original developers with the aim of developing an integrated methodology. The order in which the three groups were assigned followed a logical sequence that ensured that the maximum efficiency would be obtained, and that the blinding process would not be compromised. The claims were investigated based on the hypotheses proving symptoms are reproducible when applying identical proving methodologies in consecutive years, that different methodologies yield different numbers, types and quality symptoms, that differences exist between the symptoms yielded by the placebo and the verum groups within the same methodology, and that an integrated methodology could be developed based on the study of the relative efficiency of the respective methodologies. METHOD During the course of the research, 70 provers were recruited to test the unknown substance through application of the three methodologies Page iii mentioned above. Each of the three groups comprised of 10 verum provers per year, thus totalling 20 verum provers per group. The second group had an additional 10 provers, comprised of five placebo provers for 2008 and 2009 respectively. RESULTS The rubrics produced in each group were statistically analysed. The results reflected a reasonable level of reproducibility, proving the first hypothesis, but highlighted the fact that different provers would result in different symptoms due to their individual susceptibility and sensitivity to the proving substance. This effectively proved the hypothesis that the proving effect was reproducible in consecutive years through the application of the same methodology. The result of the data collection was the formulation of 1 373 rubrics utilised for analysis purposes, resulting in 881 verified rubrics, that comprise the repertory for Protea cynaroides. From the data, it was evident that the C4 trituration and the Sherr proving methodologies yield the most rubrics. Not only do they yield a large number of rubrics, but they also yield a much larger number of rubrics than produced by the placebo portion of the Sherr proving methodology. In the Dream proving methodology group there is much less rubrics present at each rubric level than yielded by the C4 trituration and the Sherr proving methodologies. Strong chapter affinities were observable when applying the C4 and Sherr proving methodologies. The C4 methodology seem to favour the chapters dealing with the senses, evident in the Ear, Eye, Hearing, Mouth, Nose, Skin and Vision chapters where the C4 rubrics were more prevalent than the Sherr rubrics. The Sherr methodology was evident in the remainder of the chapters, indicating the wide applicability of this methodology. This proved the hypothesis that some proving methodologies are more effective than others. Page | iv The hypothesis of difference between the placebo and verum groups within the Sherr proving methodology was proven as it was evident in the number of rubrics produced by each section. The verum portion elicited 63 percent of the total rubrics compared to the placebo portion which only elicited 28 percent. Placebo provers thus elicit fewer symptoms during the proving process than verum provers, demonstrating that homoeopathic drug provings are not a placebo response, but that the administration of the medicine results in the development of clearly observable symptoms in the participants. As originally assumed, the proving did produce clearly observable symptoms in healthy provers. The symptoms gathered through the application of the methodologies were also comprehensive enough to develop a complete materia medica and repertory for Protea cynaroides. CONCLUSION From the data presented in the study, one can thus conclude that in order to elicit symptoms representing all 38 chapters present in the Protea cynaroides proving, the C4 trituration proving and the Sherr proving methodologies would have to be combined. Although Group two is able to elicit the majority of symptoms, it would be even more effective when it is combined with the C4 proving methodology, hence leading to the development of an integrated methodology combining these methods, proving the final hypothesis. The suggested integrated methodology thus comprises of firstly conducting a C4 trituration proving using at least 10 predominantly experienced C4 provers. This proving would serve to highlight the major themes. These themes can then be confirmed through secondly conducting a proving according to the Sherr methodology, in a group comprising of at least 17 provers, including a 10 percent placebo in the group. Repeated oral doses would be administered to the participants in this. At the conclusion of the second Page | v proving stage, all the data would be collated and formatted into a materia medica and repertory. It would, however, be important to prove the integrated methodology‘s usefulness through practical application, leading to the recommendation that the methodology be tested.\n",
      "Aims of Education in the Writings of Ellen White. Problem. Ellen White’s educational philosophy and its application to the aims of education have not been systematically or thoroughly addressed within the parameters and demands of a graduate thesis. The present dissertation explores the aims of education, especially the ultimate aims of education, in the writings of Ellen G. White, one of the founders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and could be of value in assessing the present Seventh-day Adventist educational enterprise. Method. This dissertation is a description and an analysis of Ellen White’s concept of education as revealed by her understanding of the aims of education. It is a documentary study, an attempt to identify, describe, analyze, and evaluate White’s statements on the aims of education on the basis of her general philosophy, with a special emphasis on epistemology. For a selected context, the educational ideas of Herbert Spencer, John Dewey, and the Manual Education movements were examined. Conclusions. The study reveals that the ultimate aims of education in the thinking of Spencer and Dewey were focused on the “complete living” and the maximum development and growth of the individual and society. These were based on their ultimate epistemological aim, namely, science, that is, scientific knowledge obtained by the scientific method. White’s ultimate aim of education is the restoration of the image of God in the human being. The chief elements in her concept of the image of God are freedom of choice, dignity, individuality, and a character of love expressed in unselfish service to God and fellow human beings. Such character includes the development of the whole being for service. The ultimate epistemological aim of education, a personal and experiential knowledge of God, is indispensable to the ultimate metaphysical and axiological educational aim, the restoration of the image of God in the human being. This ultimate aim of education is not static, but dynamic. The human being will reflect this image, the glory of God, more and more fully throughout eternity.\n",
      "Immunonutrition for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an overwhelming systemic inflammatory process associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Pharmacotherapies that moderate inflammation in ARDS are lacking. Several trials have evaluated the effects of pharmaconutrients, given as part of a feeding formula or as a nutritional supplement, on clinical outcomes in critical illness and ARDS.To systematically review and critically appraise available evidence on the effects of immunonutrition compared to standard non-immunonutrition formula feeding on mechanically ventilated adults (aged 18 years or older) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, conference proceedings, and trial registries for appropriate studies up to 25 April 2018. We checked the references from published studies and reviews on this topic for potentially eligible studies.We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing immunonutrition versus a control or placebo nutritional formula in adults (aged 18 years or older) with ARDS, as defined by the Berlin definition of ARDS or, for older studies, by the American-European Consensus Criteria for both ARDS and acute lung injury.Two review authors independently assessed the quality of studies and extracted data from the included trials. We sought additional information from study authors. We performed statistical analysis according to Cochrane methodological standards. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, ventilator days, indices of oxygenation, cardiac adverse events, gastrointestinal adverse events, and total number of adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome.We identified 10 randomized controlled trials with 1015 participants. All studies compared an enteral formula or additional supplemental omega-3 fatty acids (i.e. eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), and antioxidants. We assessed some of the included studies as having high risk of bias due to methodological shortcomings. Studies were heterogenous in nature and varied in several ways, including type and duration of interventions given, calorific targets, and reported outcomes. All studies reported mortality. For the primary outcome, study authors reported no differences in all-cause mortality (longest period reported) with the use of an immunonutrition enteral formula or additional supplements of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants (risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.07; participants = 1015; studies = 10; low-quality evidence).For secondary outcomes, we are uncertain whether immunonutrition with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants reduces ICU length of stay (mean difference (MD) -3.09 days. 95% CI -5.19 to -0.99; participants = 639; studies = 8; very low-quality evidence) and ventilator days (MD -2.24 days, 95% CI -3.77 to -0.71; participants = 581; studies = 7; very low-quality evidence). We are also uncertain whether omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants improve oxygenation, defined as ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO₂) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂), at day 4 (MD 39 mmHg, 95% CI 10.75 to 67.02; participants = 676; studies = 8), or whether they increase adverse events such as cardiac events (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.09 to 8.46; participants = 339; studies = 3; very low-quality evidence), gastrointestinal events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.75; participants = 427; studies = 4; very low-quality evidence), or total adverse events (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.23; participants = 517; studies = 5; very low-quality evidence).This meta-analysis of 10 studies of varying quality examined effects of omega-3 fatty acids and/or antioxidants in adults with ARDS. This intervention may produce little or no difference in all-cause mortality between groups. We are uncertain whether immunonutrition with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants improves the duration of ventilator days and ICU length of stay or oxygenation at day 4 due to the very low quality of evidence. Adverse events associated with immunonutrition are also uncertain, as confidence intervals include the potential for increased cardiac, gastrointestinal, and total adverse events.\n",
      "Development and validation of a crisis self‐efficacy index. Abstract This study develops a crisis self‐efficacy index to provide a tool for crisis communication researchers and practitioners to understand behavioural aspects of crisis response better. Evaluations of public's crisis self‐efficacy using this index inform strategic message development to protect the public and minimize crisis damages by identifying the public/s most in need of self‐efficacy enhancing interventions. The index also provides practitioners a useful longitudinal index to evaluate progress in crisis preparedness programs and track changes in efficacy. A four‐stage survey index development process using structural equation modelling identifies four underlying constructs of crisis self‐efficacy: action, preventive, achievement and uncertainty management.\n",

      "New Orleans' Squares 39 and 40: three centuries of change: an anthropological look at the social, economic and political effects on architecture. Buildings are a materialization of culture at a particular point in time. Subsequent modifications and new buildings express the culture at that time. The buildings of one city block, Squares 39 and 40, are examined at various points in time over the past three hundred years to document changes in the material expression of culture, and thereby, modification in the culture itself. The history of the city is viewed from the perspective of the people and the buildings of this single city block. Some historic events only peripherally affected the block and are discussed for background. A significant portion of the history of New Orleans occurred in and around this block. The three hundred years of history is divided into eight historic eras: Pioneering Period, French Colonial, Spanish Dominion, Early American Period, Economic Expansion, Antebellum and War Years, Reconstruction, and the Twentieth Century. Each era had a distinct effect on the buildings of Squares 39 and 40. The social, economic and political forces active in each historic era caused modifications in the buildings. These modifications can be read as the history of the block. Squares 39 and 40 are iconic of the city of New Orleans.\n",
      "A Personalized and Platform-Independent Behavior Control System for Social Robots in Therapy: Development and Applications. Social robots have been proven beneficial in different types of healthcare interventions. An ongoing trend is to develop (semi-)autonomous socially assistive robotic systems in healthcare context to improve the level of autonomy and reduce human workload. This paper presents a behavior control system for social robots in therapies with a focus on personalization and platform-independence. This system architecture provides the robot an ability to behave as a personable character, which behaviors are adapted to user profiles and responses during the human-robot interaction. Robot behaviors are designed at abstract levels and can be transferred to different social robot platforms. We adopt the component-based software engineering approach to implement our proposed architecture to allow for the replaceability and reusability of the developed components. We introduce three different experimental scenarios to validate the usability of our system. Results show that the system is potentially applicable to different therapies and social robots. With the component-based approach, the system can serve as a basic framework for researchers to customize and expand the system for their targeted healthcare applications.\n",
      "An analysis of the social networks of local television reporters. This study analyzed the personal and professional networks of four local television reporters using social network analysis methodology. Network analysis was carried out to the tertiary level allowing examination of demographic data for 773 individuals in the reporter networks. Analysis was conducted through the lens of media norms and routines and the sociological principle of homophily that states people are more likely to associate with people like themselves. Using as a guide, norms and routines and homophily literature as well as studies about the portrayal of minorities, the study examines how the social networks of reporters can determine how communities of color will be covered by the media. The findings show that minority reporters who have lived in the community for an extended period of time are more likely to have the social networks that will lead to meaningful and substantive coverage of minority communities.\n",
      "How reliable are self-assessments using mobile technology in healthcare? The effects of technology identity and self-efficacy. Traditionally in clinics or hospitals, it is the staff (physician, nurses, and so forth) who would check the patient's health status (e.g., blood pressure, height, weight, body temperature, and so forth). However, when mobile apps are used as the point of contact between patients and healthcare providers, the self-monitoring of health status will be exposed to biases due to being done by common people. Therefore ‘self-report reliability’ becomes an essential factor in the mobile healthcare context. Drawing on ‘technology identity’ and ‘technology self-efficacy’ literature, we theorized that perceived mobile technology identity directly affects self-report reliability, and perceived self-efficacy moderates the relationship between the two. A sample of patients from a clinic who completed a survey and self-reported their health status using a mobile health app was collected. The results of the analyses suggest that academic education affects the reliability of self-reports. In addition, patients aged 61 and above were more accurate in reporting their health status. Moreover, we found that self-efficacy improves the accuracy of self-reports and moderates the effect of mobile technology identity on self-report reliability. The findings of this paper contribute to the ongoing research around mobile healthcare application use and issues surrounding this phenomenon.\n",
      "Electrical detection of pathogenic bacteria in food samples using information visualization methods with a sensor based on magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with antimicrobial peptides. Outbreaks of foodborne diseases demand simple, rapid techniques for detecting pathogenic bacteria beyond the standard methods that are not applicable to routine analysis in the food industry and in the points of food consumption. In this work, we developed a sensitive, rapid and low-cost assay for detecting Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhi) in potable water and apple juice. The assay is based on electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements with screen-printed interdigitated electrodes coupled with magnetite nanoparticles functionalized with the antimicrobial peptide melittin (MLT). The data were analyzed with the information visualization methods Sammon's Mapping and Interactive Document Map to distinguish samples at two levels of contamination from food suitable for consumption. With this approach it has been possible to detect E. coli concentration down to 1 CFU mL-1 in potable water and 3.5 CFU mL-1 in apple juice without sample preparation, within only 25 min. This approach may serve as a low-cost, quick screening procedure to detect bacteria-related food poisoning, especially if the impedance data of several sensing units are combined.\n",
      "Predictive Value of Three Different Selection Methods for Admission of Motivated and Well-Performing Veterinary Medical Students. In search for valid and reliable selection methods that predict applicants’ study motivation and academic performance during the 3-year bachelor’s program at the Dutch Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (FVM), this study aimed to (1) examine the predictive value of the three FVM selection methods for study motivation and academic performance (i.e., direct admission and weighted lottery based on secondary school grade point average [GPA], and selection based on non-cognitive criteria), and (2) examine whether type and level of study motivation could be of value regarding selection of well-performing students. Data from two cohorts at the FVM ( n = 186) were obtained, including mean summed scores on study motivation (using the Academic Motivation Scale [AMS] and additional items) and several academic outcome measures; among others, analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed to examine differences between the three admission groups. Spearman’s correlations and linear regression were applied to examine the relationship between study motivation and academic performance. Lottery-admitted students demonstrated a stronger extrinsic motivation than selected students ( p &lt; .05). Directly admitted students outperformed students from the other two admission groups on several academic outcome measures ( p &lt; .05). Only the level of motivation was related to academic performance ( p &lt; .05). According to the results, direct admission based on a high secondary school GPA in particular has predictive value for good academic performance during the 3-year bachelor’s program of the veterinary course. The type of motivation seems to be of no value regarding selection of well-performing students, whereas level of motivation might be a useful criterion for this purpose.\n",
      "Algorithms for Automatic Analysis and Classification of Heart Sounds–A Systematic Review. Cardiovascular diseases currently pose the highest threat to human health around the world. Proper investigation of the abnormalities in heart sounds is known to provide vital clinical information that can assist in the diagnosis and management of cardiac conditions. However, despite significant advances in the development of algorithms for automated classification and analysis of heart sounds, the validity of different approaches has not been systematically reviewed. This paper provides an in-depth systematic review and critical analysis of all the existing approaches for automatic identification and classification of the heart sounds. All statements on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2009 Checklist were followed and addressed thoroughly to maintain the quality of the accounted systematic review. Out of 1347 research articles available in the academic databases from 1963 to 2018, 117 peer-reviewed articles were found to fall under the search and selection criteria of this paper. Amongst them: 53 articles are focused on segmentation, 72 of the studies are related to the feature extraction approaches and 88 to classification, and 56 reported on the databases and heart sounds acquisition. From this review, it is clear that, although a lot of research has been done in the field of automated analysis, there is still some work to be done to develop robust methods for identification and classification of various events in the cardiac cycle so that this could be effectively used to improve the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases in combination with the wearable mobile technologies.\n",
      "Academic Grit Scale: Psychometric properties and associations with achievement and life satisfaction. After a decade of research, grit has been linked to many adaptive outcomes for adolescents and the development of school-based interventions for promoting adolescents' grit has been recommended. However, a reconceptualization of grit and its measurement may be vital for future grit research and application. The currently predominant grit assessments may be inappropriate for youth populations, yielding evidence of low psychometric properties and variable criterion-related validity. In a sample of adolescents (N = 757) in sixth to eighth grade, the current study investigated the psychometric properties of the Academic Grit Scale, a novel measure of domain-specific grit. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed a single-factor structure of the Academic Grit Scale, and evidence of high internal consistency reliability and construct validity was observed. Results indicated positive associations between academic grit and academic achievement, life satisfaction, and school satisfaction. Furthermore, academic grit demonstrated incremental validity above and beyond that of general grit in association with these outcomes. Implications of the findings are discussed, including the potential to inform applied practices in schools and future empirical investigations.\n",
      "Dietary supplementation with strawberry induces marked changes in the composition and functional potential of the gut microbiome in diabetic mice. Gut microbiota contributes to the biological activities of berry anthocyanins by transforming them into bioactive metabolites, and anthocyanins support the growth of specific bacteria, indicating a two-way relationship between anthocyanins and microbiota. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that strawberry supplementation alters gut microbial ecology in diabetic db/db mice. Control (db/+) and diabetic (db/db) mice (7 weeks old) consumed standard diet or diet supplemented with 2.35% freeze-dried strawberry (db/db + SB) for 10 weeks. Colon contents were used to isolate bacterial DNA. V4 variable region of 16S rRNA gene was amplified. Data analyses were performed using standardized pipelines (QIIME 1.9 and R packages). Differences in predictive metagenomics function were identified by PICRUSt. Principal coordinate analyses confirmed that the microbial composition was significantly influenced by both host genotype and strawberry consumption. Further, α-diversity indices and β-diversity were different at the phylum and genus levels, and genus and operational taxonomical units levels, respectively (P<.05). At the phylum level, strawberry supplementation decreased the abundance of Verrucomicrobia in db/db + SB vs. db/db mice (P<.05). At the genus level, db/db mice exhibited a decrease in the abundance of Bifidobacterium, and strawberry supplementation increased Bifidobacterium in db/db + SB vs. db/db mice (P<.05). PICRUSt revealed significant differences in 45 predicted metabolic functions among the 3 groups. Our study provides evidence for marked changes in the composition and functional potential of the gut microbiome with strawberry supplementation in diabetic mice. Importantly, strawberry supplementation increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria Bifidobacterium which play a pivotal role in the metabolism of anthocyanins.\n",
      "Organic food consumerism through social commerce in China. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of consumers’ attitudes towards organic food on online impulse buying behaviour as well as the moderating effect of three website features (visual, information and navigation design) on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach Survey data were collected via an online survey using social media platforms. A total of 653 online questionnaires were collected (response rate = 72.5 per cent) and analysed by applying exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The proposed hypotheses were tested through structural equation modelling. Findings Social media forums, ratings and reviews shape Chinese consumers’ attitudes towards organic food and positively influence their online impulse buying in this market. Website features are critical for disseminating information on organic food. Informative webpages featuring product quality and certification have a greater moderating effect on purchase. Information cues such as nutritional content; production and processing methods, and environmentally friendliness also influence consumers’ attitudes and thus impulse buying decisions. Practical implications Marketers should reconsider their tactics for dealing with modern consumers, as webpages should be user-friendly and visually appealing with a social learning mechanism to drive organic food consumption. Originality/value This study bridges a gap in the literature on social commerce initiatives for developing consumers’ attitudes towards organic food and online impulse buying. Further, it proposes measures that can enhance organic consumption and contributes to the literature on the importance of social factors, resulting in enhanced knowledge on the online impulse buying of organic food.\n",
      "Representing gender-based violence in teen series: young people’s discourses on the Spanish series<i>Física o Química</i>. Through the analysis of the fans’ forum of a popular Spanish teen series, Física o Química (2008–2011), this study explores what meanings audiences give to the series’ representation of gender violence, focussing on how they deal with the representation of male aggression towards women and how audiences reflect on gender stereotypes and unequal romantic and sexual adolescent relationships. This qualitative analysis has been carried out inductively, according to the principles of grounded theory. The analysis revealed that adolescents have internalized a series of stereotypes and myths of romantic love that can be very dangerous because they justify violence of men towards women. However, it is the actual representations in this series that lead viewers to question the myths, and thus, to talk about gender-based violence among adolescents, to reflect on it and the dangers of romantic idealization. This happens because the series takes the risk of presenting controversial and provocative representations that brings dilemmas out in the open, without trying to be moralizing with audiences, letting them discuss these representations among themselves in the fan forum.\n",
      "The Ethical Treatment of Artificially Conscious Robots. The ethical aspects of robotics have recently gained sufficient importance to be debated in international forums and to be endowed with their own collective nametag—roboethics. Almost all of the discussion within the roboethics community and elsewhere has thus far centred on questions of the form: “Is it ethical to develop and use robots for such-and-such a purpose?”, questions based upon doubts about the effect that a particular type of robot is likely to have, both on society in general and on those with whom the robots will interact in particular. What has usually been missing from the debate is the complementary question: “Is it ethical to treat robots in such-and-such a way?” Here we attempt to redress the balance, having first reviewed some of the relevant literature.\n",
      "The Smoke of War: From<i>Tamburlaine</i>to<i>Henry V</i>. Early in Tamburlaine Part 1, Marlowe’s protagonist promises that his army’s bullets, “[e]nrolde in flames and fiery smouldering mistes”, will occupy the heavens. Uniting the technological with the supernatural, Tamburlaine is characterized as a warrior who commands the “compasse of the killing bullet”, with the smoky emissions generated by his ordnance complementing his martial ambitions. As Tamburlaine and Bajazeth compete for discursive and material control of the fictional – and theatrical – air, deploying smoke, flying bullets, and airborne contagion, Marlowe’s drama introduces an association between pollution and achievement that Shakespeare would subsequently interrogate in Henry IV and Henry V. While Shakespearean characters such as Hotspur continue to celebrate the fumes of “smoky war” (1 Henry IV), Shakespeare also registers the performative risks of generating environmental pollution: an approach that culminates in Henry V when Henry’s threats conflate bullets with rotting bodies and render the air itself a poisoned weapon that “choke[s]” the atmosphere. Analysing both parts of Tamburlaine, Henry VI Part One, 1 and 2 Henry IV, and Henry V, this article explores the theatrical associations between staging battle and the weaponised use of airborne pollutants, reflecting on the implications for contemporary dramatic representations of the martial and aerial environment.\n",
      "Lamarckian Evolution of Simulated Modular Robots. We study evolutionary robot systems where not only the robot brains but also the robot bodies are evolvable. Such systems need to include a learning period right after ‘birth’ to acquire a controller that fits the newly created body. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of bootstrapping infant robot learning through employing the Lamarckian inheritance of parental controllers. In our system controllers are encoded by a combination of a morphology dependent component, a Central Pattern Generator (CPG), and a morphology independent part, a Compositional Pattern Producing Network (CPPN). This makes it possible to transfer the CPPN part of controllers between different morphologies and to create a Lamarckian system. We conduct experiments with simulated modular robots whose fitness is determined by the speed of locomotion, establish the benefits of inheriting optimized parental controllers, shed light on the conditions that influence these benefits, and observe that changing the way controllers are evolved also impacts the evolved morphologies.\n",

Nephrolithiasis is an increasingly common condition worldwide and mobile technology is revolutionizing how patients with kidney stone are being diagnosed and managed. Emerging platforms include software applications to increase adherence to stone prevention, mobile compatible hardware, online social media communities, and telemedicine. Applications and hardware specifically relevant to increasing hydration, diet modification, medication adherence, and rapid diagnosis (ie, mobile ultrasound and endoscopy) have the greatest potential to reduce stone recurrence and expedite treatment. Social media and online communities have also been rapidly adopted by patients and providers to promote education and support.\n",
      "Reducing Driver Distraction by Utilizing Augmented Reality Head-Up Display System for Rear Passengers. Long distance travelling and commuting can be particularly tiring for the driver and the rear passengers. The level of driver distraction could be further increased if younger passengers onboard are idle for long time during the drive. This paper presents a novel Augmented Reality (AR) Head-Up Display (HUD) interface that aims to attract rear passengers’ attention through assortment of infotainment applications superimposed on the side car-windows. The system additionally offers a bespoke provision of educational value, which provides superimposed data and games available for the different landmarks. The simplified interface enables the use from younger passengers and seniors alike. The proposed system has undergone two main evaluations involving 50 users and 10 families aiming to identify the system usability. The evaluation took place in a full-scale Virtual Reality driving simulator, which tested the drivers/parents’ ability to avoid collisions. The evaluation outcome offered an informative appraisal of the systems efficiency and overall positive feedback from the users.\n",
      "Systematic Review of Capnography with Mask Ventilation during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Maneuvers. The latest guidelines identify capnography as an instrument used to assess bag-valve-mask ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In this review, we analyzed the feasibility and reliability of capnography use with face mask ventilation during CPR maneuvers in adults and children. This systematic review was completed in December 2018; data for the study were obtained from the following databases: EBSCOhost, SCOPUS, PubMed, Índice Bibliográfico Español en Ciencias de la Salud (IBECS), TESEO, and Cochrane Library Plus. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the articles; we analyzed publications from different sources and identified studies that focused on the use of capnography with a face mask during CPR maneuvers in order to describe the capnometry value and its correlation with resuscitation outcomes and the assistance of professionals. A total of 888 papers were collected, and 17 papers were included that provided objective values for the use of capnography with a mask for ventilation. Four were randomized clinical trials (RCT) and the rest were observational studies. Four studies were completed in adults and 13 were completed in newborns. After the analysis of the papers, we recommended a capnographic level of C in adults and B in newborns. Despite the little evidence obtained, capnography has been demonstrated to facilitate the advanced clinical practice of mask ventilation in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, to be reliable in the early detection of heart rate increase in newborns, and to asses in-airway patency and lung aeration during newborn resuscitation.\n",

      "RNA-Mediated Virus Assembly: Mechanisms and Consequences for Viral Evolution and Therapy. Viruses, entities composed of nucleic acids, proteins, and in some cases lipids lack the ability to replicate outside their target cells. Their components self-assemble at the nanoscale with exquisite precision-a key to their biological success in infection. Recent advances in structure determination and the development of biophysical tools such as single-molecule spectroscopy and noncovalent mass spectrometry allow unprecedented access to the detailed assembly mechanisms of simple virions. Coupling these techniques with mathematical modeling and bioinformatics has uncovered a previously unsuspected role for genomic RNA in regulating formation of viral capsids, revealing multiple, dispersed RNA sequence/structure motifs [packaging signals (PSs)] that bind cognate coat proteins cooperatively. The PS ensemble controls assembly efficiency and accounts for the packaging specificity seen in vivo. The precise modes of action of the PSs vary between viral families, but this common principle applies across many viral families, including major human pathogens. These insights open up the opportunity to block or repurpose PS function in assembly for both novel antiviral therapy and gene/drug/vaccine applications.\n",
      "Effects of oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics in overweight and obese adults: a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized trials. Recent evidence suggests that modulation of the gut microbiota may contribute to body weight control. This systematic review aimed to assess the effects of oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics on body weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference in overweight and obese adults (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2). Five electronic databases—PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library/CENTRAL, LILACS, and Web of Science—were searched from inception to August 2017. No language restrictions were applied. Randomized and quasi-randomized parallel trials that assessed the effects of oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics vs any other intervention but bariatric surgery or fecal transplantation in overweight or obese adults were selected. Three teams of 2 authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included trials. Data were pooled using inverse-variance random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. Nineteen randomized trials (28 publications, 1412 participants) were included. There were no differences in mean body weight change [mean difference (MD), −0.54 kg; 95%CI, −1.09 to 0.01; I2 = 0%; moderate quality of evidence) or mean BMI change (MD, −0.19 kg/m2; 95%CI, −0.43 to 0.04; I2 = 51%; low quality of evidence) between groups who received probiotics or synbiotics and control groups. Oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics reduced mean waist circumference compared with control (MD, −0.82 cm; 95%CI, −1.43 to −0.21; I2 = 46%; low quality of evidence). The findings suggest that oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics has a small effect to reduce waist circumference but no effect on body weight or BMI, although the quality of evidence is low to moderate. Therefore, the current evidence is not definitive. Large-scale trials are needed and may help to better inform clinical practice. PROSPERO registration number CRD42018075126.\n",
      "Home robotic devices for older adults: Opportunities and concerns. Robotic devices for older adults are becoming a reality. New robots are being introduced for the growing subpopulation of healthy older adults, with an emphasis on supporting the positive aspects of aging. In order to inform the design and implementation of such robots, the relevant needs and concerns of this population should be studied, mapped, and translated into recommendations. We present a qualitative study of thirty cognitively-intact older adults, evaluating their attitudes and emotional reactions towards different types of home robotic devices. Interview analysis of participants reactions to videos of six devices uncovered four user needs that can be threatened by the introduction of home robots: the need for independence, the need for control, the fear of being replaced, and the need for authenticity. Furthermore, results reveal that cognitively-intact older adults are willing to adopt robotic devices into their homes, contingent upon their preferences and concerns being addressed. We provide recommendations regarding how researchers and designers of home robots can better address the user needs of healthy older adults by leveraging aspects of the robot's function, speech, appearance, size, proactivity, and mobility.\n",
      "Digital Disruptions and the Workplace. From the problem of unemployment caused by retrenchment to underemployment where people have not been able to access the workforce, the latest discussion has been on the topic of employability—are individuals good enough to be considered for a job? In the West alone, hundreds of millions of working-age individuals are left out of the workforce. Many more in the other parts of the world with even higher numbers of people without a job. The large economies (both developed and fast-developing) make up the bulk of these numbers and their youths needs to be equipped with digital skills or retrained for the digital economy.\n",
      "Anatomy of an Addict: Junie McCree and the Vaudeville Dope Fiend. In 1900, performer Junie McCree debuted a new character on the stage of vaudeville theatres in New York City. In a short playlet written by McCree entitled The Dope Fiend; or, Sappho in Chinatown , the actor took to the stage in a black suit, fedora, and thick mustache to perform a comic version of an opium-smoking addict from the West of the United States. McCree's addict was marked by his slumped posture, his wisecracks and chicanery, and a broad assortment of inventive slang that was intended as a sign of the character's frontier roots. Undermining expectations regarding addicts as vicious or subhuman, this vaudeville dope fiend was charming in his insouciance and playfully eccentric in behavior. McCree's interpretation was distinct from the already established stage drunk or tramp clown; he was not sloppy or bedraggled, but more the figure of a slow-moving but cunning saloon poet. McCree quickly became famous for the portrayal, spawning numerous imitators who helped make the vaudeville dope fiend a standard character convention, recognizable to Progressive Era audiences of variety entertainment, but almost entirely ignored by modern scholarship. Dissecting the anatomy of McCree's characterization, including its sources and cultural impact, this article argues for the inclusion of the comic dope fiend in the pantheon of stage characters from the period and calls attention to popular entertainment's contribution to the national debate over drug addiction.\n",
      "Augmented Reality Brings the Real World into Natural History Dioramas with Data Visualizations and Bioacoustics at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Abstract This paper introduces the AR Perpetual Garden App and highlights reasons why it is unique and important in its use of immersive, augmented reality for informal learning. The design and construction of the application created a virtual diorama based on facts, using realistic 3D models and accurate perspective. Design affordances permit annotations with interactive and multimodal facts and stories, delivering interactive knowledge artifacts. The app combines real and virtual into one holistic and comprehensive learning experience, transferring scientific knowledge to the novice in an instant. The use of immersive augmented reality produced from accurate information, data visualizations, and bioacoustics creates context‐sensitivity experiences inside the gallery and outside in the gardens. Distribution through the Apple and Google app stores to schools and homes can extend the broader impact of the educational mission of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and its biological research center, the Powdermill Nature Reserve.\n",
      "A meta regression analysis of quality of life correlates in adults with ASD. In this meta-regression analysis, we investigated Pearson’s r correlations between Quality of Life (QoL) and several putative correlates, including (a) age, (b) intellectual quotient (IQ), (c) autism severity, and (d) social functioning (SF). Robust variance estimation was used to synthesize the effect sizes from published and unpublished studies/datasets. One hundred sixty five effect sizes (extracted from 17 studies/datasets) comprising a total of 1721 participants with ASD (mean age = 35.64 years; mean percent male = 62.24%) were retrieved. Summary effect sizes derived from unconditional meta-regressions for the association between QoL and age, IQ, and autism severity were close to zero and statistically insignificant. In contrast, the summary effect size for the association between QoL and social functioning was statistically significant and moderately sized. Of the correlates we examined, only social functioning appears to bear significant summary-level associations with QoL. Improvements in social functioning may enhance QoL in adults with ASD. Alternatively, interventions aimed at neurotypical populations that promote ASD acceptance may lead to increased QoL that is not dependent on social functioning. Factors other than normative adult outcomes that may influence adult QoL should be explored.\n",
      "Escaping Oz: Autonomy in Socially Assistive Robotics. The field of socially assistive robotics (SAR) aims to supplement the efforts of clinicians, therapists, educators, and caregivers through individualized, socially mediated interventions with robots. SAR is faced with the interdisciplinary challenge to balance sensitive domain needs with current technical limitations. Many researchers in SAR and the broader human–robot interaction community overcome technical barriers by using a Wizard of Oz approach, or teleoperation of the robot or aspects of the interaction. Although Wizard of Oz is a well-established practice, it becomes intractable in critical SAR domains that require long-term, situated support, such as aging in place and special needs education. In this article, we define a set of autonomy-centric design properties for SAR interventions based on concepts from artificial intelligence and robotics. These properties structure a systematic review of the last decade of autonomous SAR research. From the review, we draw and discuss common computational methods, engineering practices, and design patterns that enable autonomy in SAR.\n",
      "(How) Does Information Provided by Children Affect the Transition from Primary to Secondary School?. The transition from primary to secondary school comes with changes in both the social- and the school context. This study focuses on assessing the concerns, expectations and experiences of 371 Dutch children making the transition. Data have been collected during four years. Also the effect of information to the mentor at secondary school on the transition is assessed through a blinded experiment. Results show that some children are more vulnerable for a poor transition such as children at special education schools, anxious children, and to a lesser extent, girls. However the results do not show that children who informed their mentor made a better transition. The intervention only has a small effect on the social context.\n",
      "Reinforcement learning: bringing together computation and cognition. A key aspect of human intelligence is our ability to learn very quickly. This ability is still lacking in artificial intelligence. This article will highlight recent research showing how bringing together the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science may benefit both. Ideas from artificial intelligence have provided helpful formal theories to account for aspects of human learning. In return, ideas from cognitive science and neuroscience can also inform artificial intelligence research with directions to make algorithms more human-like. For example, recent work shows that human learning can only be understood in the context of multiple separate, interacting memory systems, rather than as a single, complex learner. This insight is starting to show promise in improving artificial agents’ learning efficiency.\n",
      "The effect of embedded academic literacy activities on student writing in a distance learning module. Academic literacy (AL) is widely considered as central to academic knowledge building and success (Coffin & Donohue, 2014; Snow, 2010; Woodward-Kron, 2002). Evidence also indicates that AL may pose challenges to many students at risk of underachievement (Cummins, 2014). Given the disciplinary variation and associated AL practices (Haneda, 2014), early childhood studies is distinct from other disciplines. However, it is recognised that not all students come to higher education equipped with it and often students are blamed for this (Wingate, 2018). Importantly, there is limited evidence of how embedding AL in a discipline such as early childhood studies supports first year students (cf. Veitch, Johnson, & Mansfield, 2016). This paper, which relates to the conference theme of Curriculum Development, reports on an exploratory study examining Early Childhood degree students’ perspectives on the effect of embedded AL activities (e.g., constructing an academic argument, designing an essay introduction) on their academic writing. \n",

      "The study context was a collaboration between an AL specialist and a team of early childhood studies academics to innovate an early childhood course. The research involved a mixed methods approach with the aim of supporting the corroboration of findings. Data gathering was sequential (Johnson and Onwuegbuzie 2009) with the main focus on generating qualitative data initially and quantitative information at the final stage. The data was drawn from student interviews (15 transcripts), an online survey (35 responses) and written assignments (30 scripts). The five student interviews were conducted by an independent researcher after they completed the second, fourth and final assignment. The written assignments were collected from the interviewees soon after each interview. The survey was administered at the end of the course. The student interviews were thematically analysed using an approach informed by grounded theory (Corbin, Strauss, & Strauss, 2008) while the written assignments were examined through a genre analysis approach drawing on Martin and Rose (2008).\n",

This study has implications for designing a subject curriculum which aims to develop both disciplinary knowledge and AL to understand and communicate such knowledge. Equally, it provides further insights into disciplinary writing pedagogy.\n",

      "A hybrid genetic algorithm for multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem considering transportation time. Purpose Flexible job-shop scheduling is significant for different manufacturing industries nowadays. Moreover, consideration of transportation time during scheduling makes it more practical and useful. The purpose of this paper is to investigate multi-objective flexible job-shop scheduling problem (MOFJSP) considering transportation time. Design/methodology/approach A hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) approach is integrated with simulated annealing to solve the MOFJSP considering transportation time, and an external elitism memory library is employed as a knowledge library to direct GA search into the region of better performance. Findings The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on different MOFJSP taken from literature. Experimental results show that proposed algorithm performs better than the original GA in terms of quality of solution and distribution of the solution, especially when the number of jobs and the flexibility of the machine increase. Originality/value Most of existing studies have not considered the transportation time during scheduling of jobs. The transportation time is significantly desired to be included in the FJSP when the time of transportation of jobs has significant impact on the completion time of jobs. Meanwhile, GA is one of primary algorithms extensively used to address MOFJSP in literature. However, to solve the MOFJSP, the original GA has a possibility to get a premature convergence and it has a slow convergence speed. To overcome these problems, a new hybrid GA is developed in this paper.\n",
      "Fecal microbiota transplants: emerging social representations in the English-language print media. This study investigates how English-language news sources have represented fecal microbiota transplants (FMT). FMT involves transferring stool from a healthy donor to a recipient with a dysfunctional intestinal flora in order to repopulate their gut microbiome. FMT applications are increasingly moving into mainstream clinical care. We investigate press coverage of stool transplants, as well as broader themes associated with health and the gut microbiome, in order to uncover emerging social representations. Our findings show that print media focused in particular on creating novel, mainly hopeful, social representations of feces through wordplay and punning, side-lining issues of risk and fear. We also identify changing metaphorical framings of microbes and bacteria from “enemies” to “friends”, and ways in which readers are familiarized with FMT through the depiction of the process as both mundane and highly medicalized.\n",
      "Assessing a possible vulnerability to dental caries in individuals with rare genetic diseases that affect the skeletal development. Individuals diagnosed with a rare genetic disease that affects skeletal development often have physical limitations and orofacial problems that exert an impact on oral health. The aim of the present study was to analyze the possible vulnerability to dental caries in individuals with rare genetic diseases that affect skeletal development. A paired cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of 140 individuals [70 with rare genetic diseases affecting skeletal development: mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) (n = 29) and osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) (n = 41) and 70 without rare diseases] and their parents/caregivers. The participants in the first group were recruited from two reference hospitals specialized in rare genetic diseases in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. All participants were examined for the evaluation of breathing type, malocclusion, dental anomalies, oral hygiene and dental caries. The parents/caregivers answered a structured questionnaire addressing the individual/behavioral characteristics and medical/dental history of the participants. Statistical analysis involved the chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis for the dependent variable (dental caries) (α = 5%). This study received approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. The mean age of the individuals was 10.34 ± 6.55 years (median: 9.50 years). Individuals with inadequate oral hygiene were 4.70–fold more likely to have dental caries (95% CI: 2.13–10.40) and those with the rare genetic diseases (MPS/OI) were 2.92-fold more likely to have dental caries (95% CI: 1.38–6.17). Individuals with inadequate oral hygiene and those with MPS and OI had a greater chance of belonging to the group with dental caries. Based on the present findings, individuals with the rare genetic diseases may be considered vulnerable to caries.\n",
      "Atomic-SDN: Is Synchronous Flooding the Solution to Software-Defined Networking in IoT?. The adoption of software defined networking (SDN) within traditional networks has provided operators the ability to manage diverse resources and easily reconfigure networks as requirements change. Recent research has extended this concept to IEEE 802.15.4 low-power wireless networks, which form a key component of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the multiple traffic patterns necessary for SDN control makes it difficult to apply this approach to these highly challenging environments. This paper presents Atomic-SDN, a highly reliable and low-latency solution for SDN in low-power wireless. Atomic-SDN introduces a novel synchronous flooding (SF) architecture capable of dynamically configuring SF protocols to satisfy complex SDN control requirements, and draws from the authors' previous experiences in the IEEE EWSN Dependability Competition: where SF solutions have consistently outperformed other entries. Using this approach, Atomic-SDN presents considerable performance gains over other SDN implementations for low-power IoT networks. We evaluate the Atomic-SDN through simulation and experimentation, and show how utilizing SF techniques provides latency and reliability guarantees to SDN control operations as the local mesh scales. We compare the Atomic-SDN against the other SDN implementations based on the IEEE 802.15.4 network stack, and establish that the Atomic-SDN improves SDN control by orders-of-magnitude across latency, reliability and energy-efficiency metrics.\n",
      "Assessing the Irritable and Defiant Dimensions of Youth Oppositional Behavior Using CBCL and YSR Items. Research suggests that irritability and defiance are distinct dimensions of youth oppositionality that are differentially associated with internalizing and conduct problems, respectively. Because much of this evidence has emerged with limited psychometric evaluation, we conducted the first multi-informant examination of selected Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self Report (YSR) items for measuring irritability and defiance in a large clinical sample. Clinically referred youths (N = 1,030; ages 6–15; 43% female, 42% ethnic minority) were assessed prior to treatment using multi-informant rating scales and diagnostic interviews. Analyses examined factor structure, invariance, internal consistency, multi-informant patterns, and convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity with internalizing and externalizing problems/disorders. A correlated 2-factor model of irritability (stubborn/sullen/irritable, mood, temper) and defiance (argues, disobeys-home, disobeys-school) fit well for both informants. Adequate measurement invariance and scale consistency was consistently found for parent-report but not youth-report. With both informants, all hypothesized convergent and discriminant validity associations were supported: irritability and defiance with internalizing and conduct scales, respectively. However, hypothesized criterion validity associations were largely found only by parent-report: irritability with anxiety and depressive disorders, defiance with conduct disorder, and both with oppositional defiant disorder. Results consistently supported the reliability and validity of the CBCL irritability and defiance scales, with somewhat less consistent support for the YSR scales. Thus, CBCL items may provide psychometrically sound assessment of irritability and defiance, whereas further research is needed to advance youth-report and multi-informant strategies. Results also provide further support for a two subdimension model of oppositional defiant disorder symptoms that includes irritability and defiance.\n",
      "The Effects of Alcohol Consumption on Recovery Following Resistance Exercise: A Systematic Review. Background: The aim of this manuscript was to describe the effects of alcohol ingestion on recovery following resistance exercise. Methods: A literature search was performed using the following database: Web of Science, NLM Pubmed, and Scopus. Studies regarding alcohol consumption after resistance exercise evaluating recovery were considered for investigation. The main outcomes took into account biological, physical and cognitive measures. Multiple trained researchers independently screened eligible studies according to the eligibility criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Results: A total of 12 studies were considered eligible and included in the quantitative synthesis: 10 included at least one measure of biological function, 10 included at least one measure of physical function and one included measures of cognitive function. Conclusions: Alcohol consumption following resistance exercise doesn’t seem to be a modulating factor for creatine kinase, heart rate, lactate, blood glucose, estradiol, sexual hormone binding globulin, leukocytes and cytokines, C-reactive protein and calcium. Force, power, muscular endurance, soreness and rate of perceived exertion are also unmodified following alcohol consumption during recovery. Cortisol levels seemed to be increased while testosterone, plasma amino acids, and rates of muscle protein synthesis decreased.\n",
      "VPS Tactile Display. One of the challenges in the field of haptics is to provide meaningful and realistic sensations to users. While most real world tactile sensations are composed of multiple dimensions, most commercial product only include vibration as it is the most cost effective solution. To improve on this, we introduce VPS (Vibration, Pressure, Shear) display, a multi-dimensional tactile array that increases information transfer by combining Vibration, Pressure, and Shear similar to how RGB LED combines red, blue, and green to create new colors. We characterize the device performance and dynamics for each tactile dimension in terms of its force and displacement profiles, and evaluate information transfer of the VPS display through a stimulus identification task. Our results indicate that the information transfer through a single taxel increases from 0.56 bits to 2.15 bits when pressure and shear are added to vibrations with a slight decrease in identification accuracy. We also explored the pleasantness and continuity of VPS and the study results reveal that tactile strokes in shear mode alone are rated highest on perceived pleasantness and continuity.\n",
      "Seeing Like a Community: Education, Citizenship, and Social Change in the Eastern Arctic. Relying heavily on the analyses of Inuit, this dissertation examines the implications of the historical and contemporary set of Inuit-state relations in one policy area - education - over a long period of time. It undertakes this examination by analyzing the local state and societal responses to the introduction of political, social and economic institutions that were imported from southern Canada and imposed on the Inuit societies of the Eastern Arctic.It is well known that formal schooling was used as a key instrument of colonial intervention and oppression in the Eastern Arctic, and that the legacies of this intervention continue to effect communities today. At the same time, education is often identified as an essential component of Inuit self-determination. Despite 50 years of increased political control by Inuit over education, including the creation of a \"made-in- Nunavut\" education system, educational outcomes have not improved dramatically, Inuit continue to call for greater local control, and the school is still seen by many to be a foreign institution.This dissertation argues that the persistent problems with the school system are symptoms of a deeper disconnect between citizens and the institutions that structure their daily lives. Building on Scott (1998) it argues that the enduring focus on the issue of local control over the education system in Nunavut is evidence of an implicit recognition by Inuit of the importance of intermediary social institutions for successful institution- and state-building.This dissertation uses qualitative methods and a multi-scalar analysis that moves between federal and territorial politics and policy on education, and a detailed microlevel examination of Igloolik society in order to explore and understand the nuances and lived-experiences of the people - the citizens - who were (and remain) directly affected by political and policy decisions made elsewhere. These experiences and lessons from Igloolik then inform an analysis of contemporary attempts by the Government of Nunavut to institute a system of education to meet the aspirations for Nunavut.\n",
      "GAGA: NOTES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC IDENTITY. Lady Gaga distinctively exemplifies the contemporary celebrity in popular culture because of the extent of her fame as well as because of the peculiar persona she presents to her audience of both fans and onlookers. In this paper, I discuss how the persona of the person born as Stefani Germanotta was created and subsequently maintained in a variety of ways related to her naming as Lady Gaga. Invoking the work of Erving Goffman, my discussion extends beyond an analysis of the effectiveness and fame of Lady Gaga’s presentation of self to the ensuing essence of her persona itself, that is, of Lady Gaga as Gaga rather than gaga. Not merely a brand, Lady Gaga is in more ways than only economic also what Lady Gaga has become to herself and to others. As the performer slips in and out of the many public personae she has created in her name, I argue, she has become Gaga to the public at large and, with only minimal qualification, among her once personal friends as well as in the privacy of her socially constituted self. The truth that has to be acknowledged today is that Lady Gaga has indeed become Lady Gaga.\n",
      "Virtual Reality: Where Have We Been? Where Are We Now? and Where Are We Going?. The rising popularity of virtual reality has seen a recent push in applications, such as, social media, educational tools, medical simulations, entertainment and training systems. With virtual realitythe ability to engage users for specific purposes, provides opportunities to entertain, develop cognitive abilities and technical skills outside of the standard mediums (e.g., the television or theclassroom) thereby optimizing exposure with realistic (live) opportunities. However, before these applications of virtual reality become more widespread, there are a number of open questions andissues that must be addressed including limitations, challenges, relationships between fidelity, multi-modal cue interaction, immersion, and knowledge transfer and retention. In this article, we begin with a brief overview of virtual reality methods, followed by a discussion of virtual reality and its applications (both historically, currently and in the future). We review virtual reality trends both from the early artistic days through to current day state of the art technological advancements. We explore emerging and futuristic breakthroughs - and their applications in virtual reality - showing how virtual reality will go way beyond anything we could envision. Infact, after reading this article, we hope the reader will agree, that virtual reality, is possibly one of the most powerful mediums of our time. While the earliest mechanistic virtual reality prototypes (e.g., Sensorama) allowed us to view stereoscopic 3D images accompanied by stereosound, smells, as well as wind effect - set the foundation and direction for future pioneers - there have been spearheaded developments which have continually pushed the concept of virtual reality to new domains. As virtual reality evolves, many new and yet-to-be-imagined applications will arise, but we must have understanding and patience as we wait for science, research andtechnology to mature and improve. The article ends with a short overview of future directions based upon recent breakthroughs in research and what this will mean for virtual reality in the coming years.\n",

There is a growing interest in complex, active, and immersive behavioral neuroscience tasks. However, the development and control of such tasks present unique challenges.The Unified Suite for Experiments (USE) is an integrated set of hardware and software tools for the design and control of behavioral neuroscience experiments. The software, developed using the Unity video game engine, supports both active tasks in immersive 3D environments and static 2D tasks used in more traditional visual experiments. The custom USE SyncBox hardware, based around an Arduino Mega2560 board, integrates and synchronizes multiple data streams from different pieces of experimental hardware. The suite addresses three key issues with developing cognitive neuroscience experiments in Unity: tight experimental control, accurate sub-ms timing, and accurate gaze target identification.USE is a flexible framework to realize experiments, enabling (i) nested control over complex tasks, (ii) flexible use of 3D or 2D scenes and objects, (iii) touchscreen-, button-, joystick- and gaze-based interaction, and (v) complete offline reconstruction of experiments for post-processing and temporal alignment of data streams.Most existing experiment-creation tools are not designed to support the development of video-game-like tasks. Those that do use older or less popular video game engines as their base, and are not as feature-rich or enable as precise control over timing as USE.USE provides an integrated, open source framework for a wide variety of active behavioral neuroscience experiments using human and nonhuman participants, and artificially-intelligent agents.\n",
      "The effect of teaching religious principles on the infants' growth and development. Teaching religious principles can inevitably strengthen the mothers' motivation and may improve the infant's growth indices. This study aimed to investigate the effect of teaching religious principles on the infants' growth and development from birth up to the age of 3 months.In a randomized controlled tria1, 84 primiparous women who had average or weak religious attitude were randomly divided into intervention and control groups in 2013. The intervention group attended six 90-min sessions of religious education held once a week. The control group received the routine pregnancy care. Data were collected through physical growth indices and Denver's questionnaire.A significant difference was found between the intervention and control groups regarding the head circumference at birth (34.61 ± 1.51 vs. 32.97 ± 6.98). Besides, a significant relationship was observed between religious knowledge before delivery and infants' development in gross motor skills (P = 0.047, r = 0.114) and major motor skills (P = 0.019, r = 0.359) at 1 month of age, and also language skills (P = 0.015, r = 0.119), major motor skills (P = 0.008, r = 0.404), and fine motor skills (P = 0.035, r = 0.425) at the age of 3 months in the intervention group.Training the pregnant mothers regarding religious principles was effective in some indices of infants' physical growth and development.\n",
      "Semen Characteristics and Hematology of Nigerian Local Cocks Fed Varying Dietary Levels of Ethiopian Pepper Fruit Meal. SUMMARY   This study evaluated the effect of Ethiopian pepper (Xylopia aethiopica) fruit meal (EPFM) on the semen quality and hematology of Nigerian light ecotype local cocks. A total of 90 mature cocks (weighing about 1.4 ± 1.00 kg) were randomly assorted into 5 treatments groups: T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5 with 18 cocks per treatment in a completely randomized design. The birds in T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5 were fed basal diets containing EPFM at the levels of 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 g/kg diet, respectively. Semen was collected twice per week using the abdominal massage method, while blood samples were collected at the eighth week of study for hematological analysis. Sperm concentration, sperm motility, live sperm cells, normal sperm cells, and total sperm count were higher in birds fed 2 and 4 g EPFM compared to the control group. At and above 6 g/kg diet, EPFM was observed to significantly decrease semen quality. The hematology results showed no significant differences among the different treatments in the considered indices. From these findings, we conclude that addition of EPFM up to 4 g/kg diet could be used to improve semen quality of cocks without detrimental effects on the physiological status of the birds.\n",
      "Optimization of Multi-Robot Sumo Fight Simulation by a Genetic Algorithm to Identify Dominant Robot Capabilities. This paper analyzes the multirobot sumo fight simulation. This simulation is based on a computational model of several sumo fighters, which physically interact while trying to move the opponent out of the arena (lost fight). The problem is optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA), where the capabilities of not only one particular robot but of all robots simultaneously are improved. In this particular problem setup, the problem definition changes depending on the optimization path, because all robots also get better, competing against each other. The influence of different operators of the GA is investigated and compared. This paper raises the questions, which genetically controlled capabilities (e.g. size, speed) are dominant over time and how they can be identified by a sensitivity analysis using a GA. The results shed light on which parameters are dominant. This experiment typically opens up interesting fields of further research, especially about how to address optimization problems, where the optimization process influences the search space and how to eliminate the factor of randomness.\n",
      "The Structure of the Concepts Related to Love Spectrum: Emotional Verbal Fluency Technique Application, Initial Psychometrics, and Its Validation. Love has been thoroughly studied and a variety of definitions as well as types of love have been described in the literature. Given the data presenting natural language of love concept, the aim of the two present studies is to demonstrate a new technique which enables description of the structure of emotion concepts within love spectrum. This technique is based on emotional verbal fluency tasks. The procedure and the coding system used are reported in the article along with the data on reliability and standardization of the emotional verbal fluency technique. Construct validity is demonstrated by correlations of the emotional verbal fluency tasks with semantic and letter verbal fluency tasks, while discriminant validity is shown by correlations with other measures, such as the Triangular Love Scale, the Love Attitudes Scale, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The article also presents how the emotional verbal fluency technique can be used in exploring the structure of emotion concepts within love spectrum. This is based on a hierarchical cluster analysis. An examination of connections between semantic clusters identified in the emotional verbal fluency tasks allows describing a structure of the concepts within love spectrum, such as liking, infatuation, love, and show of its differentiation. The presented technique taking into account natural language is of value in assessments of the structure of emotion concepts.\n",
      "Larviciding to prevent malaria transmission. Background Larviciding refers to the regular application of chemical or microbial insecticides to water bodies or water containers to kill the aquatic immature forms of the mosquito (the larvae and pupae). Objectives To summarize research evidence evaluating whether larviciding with chemical or microbial insecticides prevents malaria transmission. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase; CAB Abstracts; LILACS; the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the ISRCTN registry up to 6 June 2019. Selection criteria We included cluster‐randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), interrupted time series (ITS), randomized cross‐over studies, non‐randomized cross‐over studies, and controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBAs) that compared larviciding with no larviciding. Data collection and analysis We independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results Four studies (one cRCT, two CBAs, and one non‐randomized cross‐over design) met the inclusion criteria. All used ground application of larvicides (people hand‐delivering larvicides); one evaluated chemical and three evaluated microbial agents. Studies were carried out in The Gambia, Tanzania, Kenya, and Sri Lanka. Three studies were conducted in areas where mosquito aquatic habitats were less extensive (< 1 km²), and one where habitats were more extensive (> 1 km²; a cross‐over study from The Gambia). For aquatic habitats of less than 1 km², one cRCT randomized eight villages in Sri Lanka to evaluate chemical larviciding using insect growth regulator; and two CBA studies undertaken in Kenya and Tanzania evaluated microbial larvicides. In the cRCT, larviciding across all villages was associated with lower malaria incidence (rate ratio 0.24, 4649 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and parasite prevalence (risk ratio (RR) 0.26, 5897 participants, low‐certainty evidence) compared to no larviciding. The two CBA studies reported lower malaria prevalence during the intervention period (parasite prevalence RR 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.89; 70,902 participants; low‐certainty evidence). The Kenyan study also reported a reduction in the incidence of new malaria cases (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.01; 720 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). For aquatic habitats of more than 1 km², the non‐randomized cross‐over trial using microbial larvicides did not detect an effect for malaria incidence (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.65; 4226 participants), or parasite prevalence (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.20; 3547 participants); both were very low‐certainty evidence. The Gambia trial also reported the mean haemoglobin level, and there was no difference across the four comparisons (mean difference –0.13, 95% CI –0.40 to 0.13; 3586 participants). We were unable to summarize or pool entomological outcomes due to unreported and missing data. Authors' conclusions Most controlled studies on larviciding have been performed with microbial agents. Ground larviciding for non‐extensive larval habitats may have an effect on malaria transmission, and we do not know if there is an effect in large‐scale aquatic habitats. We found no studies using larviciding application techniques that could cover large aquatic habitats, such as aerial spraying using aircraft.\n",
      "The Influence of Size in Augmented Reality Telepresence Avatars. In this work, we explore how advances in augmented reality technologies are creating a new design space for long-distance telepresence communication through virtual avatars. Studies have shown that the relative size of a speaker has a significant impact on many aspects of human communication including perceived dominance and persuasiveness. Our system synchronizes the body pose of a remote user with a realistic, virtual human avatar visible to a local user wearing an augmented reality head-mounted display. We conducted a two-by-two (relative system size: equivalent vs. small; leader vs. follower), between participants study (N = 40) to investigate the effect of avatar size on the interactions between remote and local user. We found the equal-sized avatars to be significantly more influential than the small-sized avatars and that the small avatars commanded significantly less attention than the equal-sized avatars. Additionally, we found the assigned leadership role to significantly impact participant subjective satisfaction of the task outcome.\n",
      "Mapping the Mobile DNA of News. Understanding Incidental and Serendipitous Mobile News Consumption. Scholarly work argues that mobile technology facilitates serendipitous news consumption. This article examines how users understand serendipity in mobile news consumption and whether this leads to news diversity. Technology-mediated news encounters are argued to reduce news diversity, yet these theoretical filter bubbles cannot be found empirically. This paper investigates whether this might be explained by incidental news use. A mixed methods study (n = 20) was set-up, which involved interviews, on-device loggings and experience sampling data. Results show that incidental news differs in the level of user agency, ranging from responding to an unsolicited recommendation or alert; via monitoring, facilitated by a previous action (e.g. activated news notifications); to browsing or stumbling upon unexpected topics during news use. Incidental encounters become serendipitous when they provide new information or insights and consequently stick in one’s mind. Based on our findings, we further develop a conceptual model for (mobile) incidental news, which shows the interplay of news recommendations by peers, algorithms, and editors. Editorial recommendations result in topic diversity. Both peer and algorithmic recommendations lead to brand diversity, yet this remains unnoticed to audiences. Peer recommendations mostly do not lead to topic or viewpoint diversity, but are perceived as valuable when they do.\n",

      "The benefits of and barriers to using a social robot PARO in care settings: a scoping review. Given the complexity of providing dementia care in hospitals, integrating technology into practice is a high challenge and an important opportunity. Although there are a growing demand and interest in using social robots in a variety of care settings to support dementia care, little is known about the impacts of the robotics and their application in care settings, i.e., what worked, in which situations, and how.Scientific databases and Google Scholar were searched to identify publications published since 2000. The inclusion criteria consisted of older people with dementia, care setting, and social robot PARO.A total of 29 papers were included in the review. Content analysis identified 3 key benefits of and 3 barriers to the use of PARO. Main benefits include: reducing negative emotion and behavioral symptoms, improving social engagement, and promoting positive mood and quality of care experience. Key barriers are: cost and workload, infection concerns, and stigma and ethical issues. This review reveals 3 research gaps: (a) the users' needs and experiences remain unexplored, (b) few studies investigate the process of how to use the robot effectively to meet clinical needs, and (c) theory should be used to guide implementation.Most interventions conducted have been primarily researcher-focused. Future research should pay more attention to the clinical needs of the patient population and develop strategies to overcome barriers to the adoption of PARO in order to maximize patient benefits.\n",
      "Using Virtual Environments to Improve Real-World Motor Skills in Sports: A Systematic Review. In many settings, sports training can be difficult to organise, logistically complicated and very costly. Virtual environments (VE) have garnered interest as a tool to train real-world sports skills due to the realism and flexibility that they can deliver. A key assumption of VE-based training is that the learned skills and experiences transfer to the real world, but do they? Using PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review evaluated the available evidence regarding the transfer of motor skills from VE training to real-world sporting contexts. The initial search identified 448 articles, but only 4 of these articles met basic criteria necessary to assess real-world transfer. Key factors regarding the study design, learner characteristics and training environment of these studies are considered. In a relatively new area of research, the findings from these 4 articles are encouraging and provide initial support for the notion that skills training in a VE can improve real-world performance in sports. However, for a wider uptake of VEs in sports training, it is important that more research demonstrates real-world transfer. Study design recommendations are suggested for researchers, developers or trainers who are considering demonstrating real-world transfers from virtual to real-world environments.\n",
      "The Validity of Google Trends Search Volumes for Behavioral Forecasting of National Suicide Rates in Ireland. Annual suicide figures are critical in identifying trends and guiding research, yet challenges arising from significant lags in reporting can delay and complicate real-time interventions. In this paper, we utilized Google Trends search volumes for behavioral forecasting of national suicide rates in Ireland between 2004 and 2015. Official suicide rates are recorded by the Central Statistics Office in Ireland. While similar investigations using Google trends data have been carried out in other jurisdictions (e.g., United Kingdom, United Stated of America), such research had not yet been completed in Ireland. We compiled a collection of suicide- and depression-related search terms suggested by Google Trends and manually sourced from the literature. Monthly search rate terms at different lags were compared with suicide occurrences to determine the degree of correlation. Following two approaches based on vector autoregression and neural network autoregression, we achieved mean absolute error values between 4.14 and 9.61 when incorporating search query data, with the highest performance for the neural network approach. The application of this process to United Kingdom suicide and search query data showed similar results, supporting the benefit of Google Trends, neural network approach, and the applied search terms to forecast suicide risk increase. Overall, the combination of societal data and online behavior provide a good indication of societal risks; building on past research, our improvements led to robust models integrating search query and unemployment data for suicide risk forecasting in Ireland.\n",
      "Maternal influences on effortful control in adolescence: Developmental pathways to externalizing behaviors. Abstract Adolescents' effortful control is subject to numerous maternal influences. Specifically, a mother's own effortful control is associated with her child's effortful control. However, maternal substance use, psychopathology, and stress within the parenting role may also lead to poor effortful control for their child. Poor effortful control during adolescence can subsequently contribute to a variety of negative outcomes, including externalizing behaviors. A sample of 460 adolescents (47% female, 59.3% Non‐Hispanic Caucasian) was selected from a longitudinal, multigenerational study. The goal was to examine maternal effortful control, substance use, psychopathology, and stress in their offspring's childhood ( M age = 6.27) and their influence on their children's effortful control in early adolescence ( M age = 12.21) and the subsequent effect of effortful control on adolescents’ externalizing behavior ( M age = 13.53). Maternal effortful control (measured via conscientiousness) and psychopathology were associated with adolescent effortful control, which was associated with externalizing behavior a year later. Additionally, there was a significant indirect association between maternal effortful control and adolescent externalizing behaviors via adolescent effortful control. Thus, adolescent effortful control is associated with maternal effortful control but also subject to specific maternal risk factors in childhood. These results inform potential maternal strategies for promoting positive developmental outcomes in adolescents.\n",
      "Mapping ethnicity in nineteenth-century Burma: When ‘categories of people’ (<i>lumyo</i>) became ‘nations’. Successive wars and the establishment of a border between the kingdom of Burma and British India in the nineteenth century challenged Burmese conceptions of sovereignty and political space. This essay investigates how European, and more specifically Anglo-American, notions of race, nation, and consular protection to nationals, progressively informed the Burmese concepts of ‘categories of people’ (lumyo) and ‘subject’ (kyun) . First, I present the semantic evolution of these concepts in the 1820s–1830s, following the annexation of the western Burmese province of Arakan by British India in 1824. Then, I argue that the Burmese concept of lumyo was progressively associated with the European concept of ‘nations’ in the 1850s–1860s, following the annexation of Lower Burma in 1852. Finally, I uncover developments in the 1870s, when British consular protection extended to several freshly categorised ‘nations’, such as Shan, Karenni, and Kachin.\n",
      "An exploration of the perceptions and experiences of veterans transitioning to higher education. This study examined how military veterans experience transition from active duty to the classroom during the first semester at a four-year public university. Eight semi-structured interviews were conducted at a medium-sized state school located in the northeastern region of the United States. Using an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), transcripts were analyzed to identify common themes. Three major themes emerged: how do student veterans develop their identity, what challenges do they face when transitioning to college, and what environmental factors impact their success. These findings were considered within the framework of Schlossberg's Transition Theory and suggest that military students are more likely to persist and succeed when institutions of higher education recognize the needs of this unique population and provide them with the necessary resources and support.\n",
      "Unlikely Allies: A Case Study on Cross Class Protest in Guatemala. Cross-class mobilization in developing countries can be a powerful force for precipitating political change, but the literature on cross-class protest movements in developing countries has focused almost exclusively on democratization movements and has not dealt adequately with cross-class protest in other contexts. Additionally, the literature on protest movements typically focuses on the lower classes, while the upper classes are either ignored or assumed to be one-dimensional, uniform, self-interested actors who only protest when it is in their own best economic and political interest. These deficiencies in the literature have been illuminated by the massive protests that occurred in Guatemala in 2015. In a country with a long history of class antagonism, rigid social and racial cleavages, and drastic inequality, how did Guatemalans in the upper classes find common ground and solidarity with those in the lower classes? Existing literature on cross-class protests in developing countries is sparse, and argues that cross-class protests only emerge in developing countries during democratization, or in times of extreme economic problems. This paper is a preliminary investigation into the 2015 protests in Guatemala that critiques the literature on cross-class protests in developing countries, and especially in Latin America, by providing evidence obtained from interviews regarding the motivations of protesters in the upper classes. It argues that the standard image of the upper classes in developing countries as one-dimensional, uniform, rational actors is inadequate and inaccurate. Rather, they have complex motivations ranging from self-interest, to nationalism, to altruistic concern for the poor. While the findings in this paper are preliminary due to a small, non-representative sample, they reveal the need for a larger, more comprehensive project to investigate cross-class protester motivations.\n",

      "Technologies for Social Augmentations in User-Embodied Virtual Reality. Technologies for Virtual, Mixed, and Augmented Reality (VR, MR, and AR) allow to artificially augment social interactions and thus to go beyond what is possible in real life. Motivations for the use of social augmentations are manifold, for example, to synthesize behavior when sensory input is missing, to provide additional affordances in shared environments, or to support inclusion and training of individuals with social communication disorders. We review and categorize augmentation approaches and propose a software architecture based on four data layers. Three components further handle the status analysis, the modification, and the blending of behaviors. We present a prototype (injectX) that supports behavior tracking (body motion, eye gaze, and facial expressions from the lower face), status analysis, decision-making, augmentation, and behavior blending in immersive interactions. Along with a critical reflection, we consider further technical and ethical aspects.\n",
      "GENDER GAP IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS (STEM): BARRIERS AND SOLUTIONS. The purpose of this study is to identify and discuss barriers facing females in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The study looks at three developmental stages; first, school life (childhood) stage between the age of 6 and 18, second, university life (adulthood) stage from the age of 18 and 22, and third, professional life (maturity) stage from the age of 22 and above. The main findings are stereotyping and society's perception to women that lead to classification of roles and responsibilities based on gender. Parents and teachers' expectations, parents' profession, and community culture are the most factors that influence the childhood stage. Stereotyping, and low number of females in the classroom are characterized in the adulthood stage. The most important factors in the maturity stage are: (1) bias against women at work, (2) discouraging work environment for women, and (3) childbirth and maternity barriers. Few studies detailed gender barriers in STEM, especially in the region. In the light of these barriers, appropriate suggestions are put forward to overcome such barriers at each stage.Keywords: Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, Gender, School Life, University Life, Professional LifeJEL Classifications: I20, I24DOI: https://doi.org/10.32479/ijefi.8908\n",

      "Volunteer Women: Militarized Femininity in the 1916 Easter Rising. Women were an integral part to the Easter Rising, yet until recently, their contributions have been forgotten. Those who have been remembered are often women who bucked conservative Irish society’s notions of femininity and chose to actively participate in combat, which has led to a skewed narrative that favors their contributions over the contributions of other women. Historians and scholars favor these narratives because they are empowering and act as clear foils to the heroic narratives of the male leaders in the Easter Rising. In reality, however, most of the women who joined Cumann na mBan or worked for the leaders of the Easter Rising chose to do so knowing they would take on a supportive role. They did so willingly, and even put the cause of Irish independence above the need for women’s rights. Their duties reflected this reality. Once the Easter Rising was underway, women were needed to support the rebels and did so often under fire from British and Irish fighters. For their participation in the rebellion, some women were arrested, while as a whole, the contributions of these women were derided and downplayed by the larger public. Those women not imprisoned would go on to establish the martyr-myth of the heroic and male Irish revolutionaries executed for their part in the Easter Rising. This led to the women’s histories being forgotten or ignored in favor of the heroic narrative. Even when pensions were made available to compensate participants of the Easter Rising, women only applied out of need and for fear of poverty, rather than to receive recognition. To this day, Ireland and Irish history scholars have ignored the participation of gender-conforming women in favor of the more heroic narrative of women whose experiences more closely resemble those of the Easter Rising’s male martyrs.\n",

      "On-demand monitoring of construction projects through a game-like hybrid application of BIM and machine learning. While unavoidable, inspections, progress monitoring, and comparing as-planned with as-built conditions in construction projects do not readily add tangible intrinsic value to the end-users. In large-scale construction projects, the process of monitoring the implementation of every single part of buildings and reflecting them on the BIM models can become highly labour intensive and error-prone, due to the vast amount of data produced in the form of schedules, reports and photo logs. In order to address the mentioned methodological and technical gap, this paper presents a framework and a proof of concept prototype for on-demand automated simulation of construction projects, integrating some cutting edge IT solutions, namely image processing, machine learning, BIM and Virtual Reality. This study utilised the Unity game engine to integrate data from the original BIM models and the as-built images, which were processed via various computer vision techniques. These methods include object recognition and semantic segmentation for identifying different structural elements through supervised training in order to superimpose the real world images on the as-planned model. The proposed framework leads to an automated update of the 3D virtual environment with states of the construction site. This framework empowers project managers and stockholders with an advanced decision-making tool, highlighting the inconsistencies in an effective manner. This paper contributes to body knowledge by providing a technical exemplar for the integration of ML and image processing approaches with immersive and interactive BIM interfaces, the algorithms and program codes of which can help replicability of these approaches by other scholars.\n",
      "Poverty and Inequality: Exploring the Role of Tourism in Brazil's Northeast. With poverty and inequality continuing to persist around the world, eradicating both has become one of the greatest challenges for humanity. Yet, tourism has been considered as a panacea for achieving development, overcoming poverty and reducing inequality. Nonetheless, it remains unclear as to whether tourism contributes to reducing poverty and inequality or, in fact, increases both. This study explores the relationship between tourism, poverty and inequality from a political economy perspective. A multidimensional view on poverty is adopted and inequality is considered in the distribution of impacts, which is underpinned by Sen's capability approach. The political economy context of this study is analysed by using Frank's dependency theory and by drawing on Giddens' understanding of power in his structuration theory. The study is conducted in a coastal tourist destination in the Northeast of Brazil and applies a mixed-methodological approach that combines quantitative value chain analysis (VCA) and qualitative photo-elicitation and interviews. The results show that tourism has a significant impact on reducing income-poverty through providing job opportunities as micro-entrepreneurs and in un-/ and semi-skilled positions to locals from a non-white background. In contrast, tourism business owners and those in higher managerial positions are people from a white background who have moved to the Northeast. This disparity found mirrors classic development patterns in developing countries and seems to be characteristic of the coastline in Brazil's Northeast. An analysis of the value of tourism-related income through consumption patterns emphasises the importance of tourism for local people to sustain their well-being, whilst business owners and managers do not seem to depend on tourism since they are able to draw on other financial sources. Individual opportunities and wider societal benefits provided by tourism are highly valued by locals, particularly, the opportunity of having access to and contact with the rest of the world through engagement with international tourists. In contrast, tourism business owners and managers place value on living in a natural environment and having a relaxed lifestyle. Despite the value of tourism for both groups, challenges and costs of tourism development are also identified. A key constraint is found to exist in racial disparities, in that the white-skinned elite is perceived to prevent non-white locals from generating income and sustaining their livelihoods. Wider structural constraints for tourism development lie in the dependency of the destination on the municipality and a neighbouring city; nonetheless, despite existing structural constraints, agency becomes evident, suggesting that people exert some degree of power over tourism development and their livelihoods. This study provides deeper understanding of multidimensional poverty, and particularly, in connection to inequality. Furthermore, it adds to existing knowledge on power relations within and between different spatial scales and power as interplay between structure and agency.\n",
      "Robots, AI, and Cognitive Training in an Era of Mass Age-Related Cognitive Decline: A Systematic Review. Developing countries world-wide are witnessing historical growth in their elderly populations, and with it, importantly, a steady rise in the number of people experiencing age-related cognitive decline. This reality has the potential to produce an unprecedented strain on affected families, healthcare systems and taxpayers in the very near future. This study: a) examines the present limits and predicted capacity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as they relate to the various and complex needs of those hoping to optimize the positive benefits of cognitive training, and b) systematically reviews the efficacy of Human Robot Interaction (HRI) as an intervention strategy for elderly individuals confronting cognitive challenges along the spectrum from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Advanced Cognitive Impairment (ACI). The results of this systematic review suggest that, overall, the utilization of humanoid and pet robots, such as NAO and PARO, respectively, produce improvements in cognition and markers of social and emotional health and engagement; however, when embedded with AI with the capacity for Deep Learning the potential of robotic technology to aggressively meet the needs of individuals experiencing age-related cognitive decline will be significant.\n",
      "More Than a Click. Fake news can be disseminated on social media platforms due to users' inability to distinguish it from true news as well as the nature of heuristic-driven online sharing. We use in-depth semi-structured interviews with 20 college student social media users to help build a picture of their sharing processes that can help platform designers and operators better combat fake news dissemination. Participants reflected on specific recently shared news pieces, including how the stories attracted attention, why they shared them, and their behavior after sharing. Interview results revealed different cognitive processes people engaged: before, during and after sharing. Before sharing, participants assessed the news content and evaluated the social value of sharing the particular news piece. During sharing, the audience of the post was selected. After sharing, users examined the feedback from others and revisited previous sharing decisions. The study highlights that decisions about news sharing involve a myriad of different considerations throughout different cognitive stages. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications for combating the sharing of fake news.\n",

It means that it should invest in flourishing all existential dimensions of students including intellectual, emotional, social, spiritual, and moral dimensions and care for their education and productivity. Now this question arises is that since religious education is a process accomplished through granting vision, genuine and practical obligation to the person, in harmony with his nature and far from force and pressure, in order to gain this- and other-worldly prosperity, can the school undertake this important responsibility or not and in the case of disability to fulfill this duty, should religious education be deschooled; i.e. the mission of religious education should be assigned to institutions other than school or not?  The findings of this investigation show that religious education doesn’t have desirable situation and the new generation doesn’t receive the religious thoughts and behaviors as is qualified. Teachers use grade and other quantitative indices to teach values and morality and evaluate the progress in religious education of students; this results in duality of the student’s identity, personality and behavior, because they are not motivated internally to learn religious issues. On the other hand, in Islamic societies, the administrators and politicians cannot be irresponsible for the religious education of members of their society. According to the doctrines of the true religion, Islam, governors and politicians are obliged to attempt to accomplish this affair, so ministry of education in Iran as a public institution has taken the charge of this affair and schools are charged with delivering religious and divine education to the students and the necessity of deschooling the religious education is denied in Islamic republic of Iran and since our formal education is directly governed by the government and is mentioned in national document of school curriculum and also the document of fundamental transition in education, the objective of education is to educate a religious and committed human being, we may not separate the religious education of students from school. So the possibility of deschooling from religious education in Iran is denied, too. But the tenure of government and formal education relating to religious education is conditional upon conditions, that if accomplished, the tenure will be permitted. In this article these conditions are indicated in detail.\n",
      "Saving the Boat. It is fitting that the closing essay of Earth 2020 offers a youth perspective, looking to the future of our planet. Together, Craig-Sparrow and Nosek are grappling with the peril our world and our future faces. Our rapidly warming planet is pushing strained social and ecological systems to the brink, threatening all life on earth. This pressure is increased by powerful society forces, such as the fossil fuel industry and its allies, who have spent millions of dollars undermining climate science and action, leaving many people unaware of the true dangers we face and sowing doubt about whether climate change is real and human-caused. As a result, governments have been slow to act, with very few politicians demonstrating the courage to speak out on behalf of our planet. However daunting this situation is, Craig-Sparrow and Nosek assert that we must take our cue from youth climate strikers and Indigenous-led organizations, both groups which are developing creative, collaborative solutions to the climate crisis. This chapter is a rallying cry to action: despite the fact we face an uncertain future, we must still show up and fight for our planet.\n",
      "Bringing live animal closer: the visual grammar of information design in augmented reality. Augmented Reality (AR), displaying virtual elements in the real world, is a hot topic in last few decades. As the technology is limited, many of the AR conceptual designs served for mobile applications because of easy access to the camera and the portable feature of cell phones. However, the AR goal to expand the upper limit of the reality is restricted by the screen size. This thesis explores the possibilities of the visual languages in Augmented Reality using the zoo as a case study. AR real-time explanation works well within the zoo context for enhancing the visiting experience. This thesis proposed a system of visual languages and interaction workflow in AR design on mobile devices.--Author's abstract\n",
      "Prerequisites for an Artificial Self. Traditionally investigated in philosophy, body ownership and agency - two main components of the minimal self - have recently gained attention from other disciplines, such as brain, cognitive and behavioural sciences, and even robotics and artificial intelligence. In robotics, intuitive human interaction in natural and dynamic environments becomes more and more important, and requires skills such as self-other distinction and an understanding of agency effects. In a previous review article, we investigated studies on mechanisms for the development of motor and cognitive skills in robots (Schillaci et al., 2016). In this review article, we argue that these mechanisms also build the foundation for an understanding of an artificial self. In particular, we look at developmental processes of the minimal self in biological systems, transfer principles of those to the development of an artificial self, and suggest metrics for agency and body ownership in an artificial self.\n",
      "Informatics and Artificial Intelligence Approaches that Promote Use of Integrative Health Therapies in Nursing Practice: A Scoping Review. Integrative health (IH) therapies are increasingly used to manage health conditions, but barriers hindering nurses from offering IH therapies persist. Informatics and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have potential to promote nurses’ professional use of IH therapies. The purposes of this review are to (1) describe the state of the science of informatics and AI approaches promoting nurses’ use of IH therapies and (2) identify gaps in literature for future investigations. This systematic scoping review followed the systematic review guideline published by the Centre for Review and Dissemination. Five databases were used to retrieve relevant literature published between 2008 and 2018. Sixteen articles describing fourteen studies met predefined eligibility criteria and were reviewed. A descriptive numerical summary method and thematical analysis were used to synthesize the included literature. A fourfold typology emerged to label the informatics and AI approaches, including robots with AI, computer- and mobile-based applications, electronic communication using an information system, and information standards and standardized terminologies. The reviewed studies suggested that informatics and AI approaches could enhance the safety, accessibility, and communication of nursing IH therapies, as well as enable nursing IH data for IH-related knowledge discovery. Several gaps for future research were identified. There is a need of theory-informed research with more rigorous design and a larger scale to provide robust evidence for implementing existing applications and future innovations. Literature suggests progress toward use of informatics and AI approaches to support nurses’ professional use of IH therapies. Further high-quality and theory-informed research is needed regarding the applications used in conventional healthcare in supporting nurses’ use of IH therapies.\n",
      "The Politics of Social Media Manipulation. Disinformation and so-called fake news are contemporary phenomena with rich histories. Disinformation, or the willful introduction of false information for the purposes of causing harm, recalls infamous foreign interference operations in national media systems. Outcries over fake news, or dubious stories with the trappings of news, have coincided with the introduction of new media technologies that disrupt the publication, distribution and consumption of news -- from the so-called rumour-mongering broadsheets centuries ago to the blogosphere recently. Designating a news organization as fake, or der Lügenpresse, has a darker history, associated with authoritarian regimes or populist bombast diminishing the reputation of 'elite media' and the value of inconvenient truths. In a series of empirical studies, using digital methods and data journalism, the authors inquire into the extent to which social media have enabled the penetration of foreign disinformation operations, the widespread publication and spread of dubious content as well as extreme commentators with considerable followings attacking mainstream media as fake.\n",

Hanna Krauze-Sikorska, Children and adolescents with a chronic condition in the public school space – in search of an effective model of psy-chopedagogical support. Interdisciplinary Contexts of Special Pedagogy, no. 26, Poznań 2019. Pp. 205–318. Adam Mickiewicz University Press. ISSN 2300-391X. e-ISSN 2658-283X. DOI:https://doi.org/10.14746/ikps.2019.26.14Chronic condition may, in time, become a specific kind of „stigma” that determines the formation of a specific “conveyor belt” which determines the trajectories of the fate of children and adolescents. Analysing the functioning of children and adolescents with a chronic condition, for which the school should provide (as for other students) the conditions of learning, both in the cognitive and in the directional aspects, one may indicate not only the imperfections of educational activities, but also a myth of noble ideas inscribed in the function of school, as a place of universal development of every student. The article is a proposal of employing, within the process of educating children and adolescents with a chronic condition, an eclectic model of activities, based on their complexity and sequentiality. The model refers to models proposed by Frederick C. Thorne, or Richard James, used in situations of crisis intervention: the equilibrium model, the cognitive model, and the social change model.\n",
      "BUILDING UP CHARACTER VALUES THROUGH CHILDREN’S SONG. This study aims to describe the process of establishing character values through children’s songs. Factors causing the fading of children’s character are the crisis of religious values and the fading out of national cultural values which are the effects of globalization. Therefore, the establishment of character values must be carried out from early childhood. Some of the efforts that can be made are to build up some character values in early childhood through singing children’s songs in the learning process. This research used a phenomenological qualitative type of research. The research subjects were teachers, students, and parents of the Mutiara Kasih Pre-School Mangli Jember. In collecting the data, this study used interview, observation, and documentation techniques. The collected data were analyzed using a spiral analysis model having the procedures of data management, reading and memo-ing, description, classification, interpretation, and presentation/visualization. The results of the study showed that it was important to build up character values since early childhood because the establishment of character values from an early age is considered to be more effective and very influential in the future development of children. To set up these good character values in children requires a long process and must be started from early childhood. Building up character values in this school was done by singing children’s songs. Those songs are songs that contain character values. The strategies or techniques that were used in building up character values through children’s songs was done by giving exemplary and make the students get used to doing good things.\n",
      "Impact of Sensory Processing on School Performance Outcomes in High Functioning Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder. ABSTRACT Difficulty processing sensory information may impede progress in school for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We explore the relationship between sensory processing and school performance in 26 high‐functioning youths with ASD and 26 controls (age 8–14) using measures of sensory, social, cognitive, and academic functioning. In the ASD group, bivariate Pearson correlations indicated a significant positive relationship between intelligence quotient (IQ) and the School Competence Scale (SCS) of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and a significant negative relationship between Dunn's Sensory Processing Framework and SCS scores. Final hierarchical multiple linear regression model accounting for SCS scores in ASD included IQ, ADHD symptoms, and sensory features. An interaction between increased sensory sensitivity with reduced sensory avoidance behaviors explained the greatest amount of variance in SCS, meaning school performance is lowest for children with greater hypersensitivity and fewer avoidance behaviors. Results indicate a strong impact of sensory processing on school performance in ASD.\n",
      "Multidimensional Feature Classification of the Health Information Needs of Patients With Hypertension in an Online Health Community Through Analysis of 1000 Patient Question Records: Observational Study. With the rapid development of online health communities, increasing numbers of patients and families are seeking health information on the internet.This study aimed to discuss how to fully reveal the health information needs expressed by patients with hypertension in their questions in a web-based environment and how to use the internet to help patients with hypertension receive personalized health education.This study randomly selected 1000 text records from the question data of patients with hypertension from 2008 to 2018 collected from Good Doctor Online and constructed a classification system through literature research and content analysis. This paper identified the background characteristics and questioning intention of each patient with hypertension based on the patient's question and used co-occurrence network analysis and the k-means clustering method to explore the features of the health information needs of patients with hypertension.The classification system for the health information needs of patients with hypertension included the following nine dimensions: drugs (355 names), symptoms and signs (395 names), tests and examinations (545 names), demographic data (526 kinds), diseases (80 names), risk factors (37 names), emotions (43 kinds), lifestyles (6 kinds), and questions (49 kinds). There were several characteristics of the explored web-based health information needs of patients with hypertension. First, more than 49% of patients described features, such as drugs, symptoms and signs, tests and examinations, demographic data, and diseases. Second, patients with hypertension were most concerned about treatment (778/1000, 77.80%), followed by diagnosis (323/1000, 32.30%). Third, 65.80% (658/1000) of patients asked physicians several questions at the same time. Moreover, 28.30% (283/1000) of patients were very concerned about how to adjust the medication, and they asked other treatment-related questions at the same time, including drug side effects, whether to take the drugs, how to treat the disease, etc. Furthermore, 17.60% (176/1000) of patients consulted physicians about the causes of clinical findings, including the relationship between the clinical findings and a disease, the treatment of a disease, and medications and examinations. Fourth, by k-means clustering, the questioning intentions of patients with hypertension were classified into the following seven categories: \"how to adjust medication,\" \"what to do,\" \"how to treat,\" \"phenomenon explanation,\" \"test and examination,\" \"disease diagnosis,\" and \"disease prognosis.\"In a web-based environment, the health information needs expressed by Chinese patients with hypertension to physicians are common and distinct, that is, patients with different background features ask relatively common questions to physicians. The classification system constructed in this study can provide guidance to health information service providers for the construction of web-based health resources, as well as guidance for patient education, which could help solve the problem of information asymmetry in communication between physicians and patients.\n",

      "Movement on the Altar: Gothic Tabernacle-altarpieces in the Crown of Aragon (and Their Context). The arrival of tabernacle-altarpieces in regions under the Crown of Aragon makes up part of a complex context revolving around the evolution of altar furnishings from the late Romanesque to the early Gothic period. The late 13th century and first half of the 14th century saw a series of fundamental movements – changes – prior to the verticalization of altarpieces. All of this took place at the same time that specific types of altar furnishing that already existed during the Romanesque, such as those presenting a sculptural image inside a tabernacle, became steeped in new features, and evolved by taking on movable wings at the sides which could be ritually opened up. This lent them a certain theatricality and the ability to conceal and reveal, while also allowing for processes activating the central image presiding over them. These, specifically, are some of the main contributions of tabernacle-altarpieces to the history of Christian altar furnishing. In the Crown of Aragon, this type of furnishing does not appear to have become very widespread, given that we only have documentary evidence of it in Catalonia and Aragon. All the same, the exemplars that have survived respond to models and types that exactly match those found throughout the kingdom of Castile and the rest of Europe, both those presenting sculptural reliefs on their wings and those with pictorial representations. Finally, we should point out that their chronological presence spanned practically the entire Gothic period, from the early Linear Gothic years until well into the 15th century.\n",
      "Parental Education and Youth Inhibitory Control in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study: Blacks’ Diminished Returns. Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) youth are at a higher risk of high-risk behaviors compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) youth. Some of this racial gap is shown to be due to weaker effects of parental educational attainment on reducing the prevalence of behavioral risk factors such as impulsivity, substance use, aggression, obesity, and poor school performance for NHBs, a pattern called Minorities' Diminished Returns. These diminishing returns may be due to lower than expected effects of parental education on inhibitory control.We compared NHW and NHB youth for the effect of parental educational attainment on youth inhibitory control, a psychological and cognitive construct that closely predicts high-risk behaviors such as the use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.This was a cross-sectional analysis that included 4188 youth from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. The independent variable was parental educational attainment. The main outcome was youth inhibitory control measured by the stop-signal task (SST), which was validated by parent reports on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).In race/ethnicity-stratified models, high parental educational attainment was associated with a higher level of inhibitory control for NHB than NHW youth. In the pooled sample, race/ethnicity showed a statistically significant interaction with parental educational attainment on youth inhibitory control suggesting that high parental educational attainment has a smaller boosting effect on inhibitory control for NHB than NHW youth.Parental educational attainment boosts inhibitory control for NHW but not NHB youth. To minimize the racial gap in youth brain development, we need to address societal barriers that diminish the returns of family economic and human resources, particularly parental educational attainment, for racial and ethnic minority youth. Social and public policies should address structural and societal barriers such as social stratification, segregation, racism, and discrimination that hinder NHB parents' abilities to effectively mobilize their human resources and secure tangible outcomes for their developing youth.\n",
      "Fake News and Aggregated Credibility. The accelerated spread of fake news via the internet and social media such as Facebook and Twitter have created a debate concerning the credibility of sources online. Assessing the credibility of these sources is generally a complex task and cannot solely rely on computer-based algorithms as evaluation still requires human intelligence. The research question guiding this article deals with the conceptualization of a theoretically anchored concept of a participatory and co-creative medium for evaluation of sources online. The concept-driven design research methodology was applied to address the research question, which consisted of seven activities that unify design and theory. The result of this article is a proposed concept that aims to support the assessment of the credibility of sources online using crowdsourcing as an approach for evaluation. The practical implications of the proposed concept could be to constrain the spread of fake news, strengthen online democratic discourse, and potentially improve the quality of online information.\n",
      "Minorities’ Diminished Returns of Parental Educational Attainment on Adolescents’ Social, Emotional, and Behavioral Problems. Aim: To compare racial groups for the effect of parental educational attainment on adolescents’ social, emotional, and behavioral problems. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 10,762 youth from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study were included. The independent variable was parental educational attainment. The main outcomes were (1) anxious and depressed mood, (2) withdrawn and depressed affect, (3) somatic complaints, (4) social and interpersonal problems, (5) thought problems, (6) rule-breaking behaviors, (7) attention problems, and (8) violent and aggressive behaviors. These scores were generated based on parent-reported behavioral problems measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Race and ethnicity were the moderators. Linear regression was used to analyze the ABCD data. Results: Overall, high parental educational attainment was associated with lower scores across all domains. Race and ethnicity showed statistically significant interactions with parental educational attainment on adolescents’ fewer social, emotional, and behavioral problems (all domains), net of all confounders, indicating smaller tangible gains from their parental educational attainment for Black and Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic White adolescents. Conclusions: The protective effects of parental education against social, emotional, and behavioral problems are systematically diminished for Hispanic and Black than non-Hispanic White adolescents.\n",
      "The Examiner and the Evangelist: Authorities of Music and Empire, <i>c.</i>1894. Abstract In the 1890s, two musicians travelled between Britain and South Africa. One was the first examiner to travel abroad to examine for the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, Franklin Taylor. At the same time as Taylor’s arrival in the Cape in 1894, a black South African composer, John Knox Bokwe, prepared to republish a tonic sol-fa hymnal containing many hymns that eventually became popular in Britain, to which Bokwe travelled multiple times. Although these narratives might appear to reflect highly divergent contexts for musical experience, the fluctuating constructions of imperial authority encountered in the careers of both these men link their stories together more deeply than their geographical and cultural disparities set them apart. The synchronous presentation of their stories in this article thus raises questions of how music emerged as a metaphor for constructions of imperial knowledge across shifting cultural boundaries.\n",
      "0900 Obstructive Sleep Apnea Severity, Symptoms Of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder And Other Comorbid Psychiatric Disorders In Children And Adolescents: A Retrospective Data Analysis. Abstract Introduction Children and adolescents with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are often diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the connection between the severity of Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI) and ADHD is controversial with research evidence pointing in opposing directions. Methods A retrospective study was conducted in a pediatric sleep center at a university hospital setting to investigate the effect between AHI severity, ADHD and/or other comorbid psychiatric disorders. One hundred and thirty-eight participants between the age of 6 and 18 were examined in terms of AHI severity level and their correlation with scores from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) using SPSS program. Results A negative correlation between AHI scores and Attention Problems for the entire group of participants was found. Additionally, female adolescents had positive correlations between AHI scores and several affective disorder variables from the CBCL, while male adolescents had negative correlations between AHI levels and several CBCL scores that are typically associated with ADHD and Anxiety disorders. Conclusion This study suggests a relationship between OSA severity and psychiatric conditions. However, this relationship can vary depending on age, gender and AHI severity. More research is required to understand this relationship. Support Chervin, R.D. How many children with ADHD have sleep apnea or periodic leg movements on polysomnography?

      "The journey from “weak” protection to imprisonment due to radicalization: Treating affective bonds. Adolescence is a time of identity upheaval. This period is much more complex for teenagers who have faced numerous difficulties during their childhood, for example if they have been exposed to early relational trauma or have a “traumatophilic” family history. These teenagers’ explosive problems are difficult for child welfare services to deal with, and their lack of adjustment to their problematic situations makes it impossible for them to settle into their care placements.Using an example of the care of a teenage convert to radical Islam who was taken into care and then sent to prison, I attempt to show the processes at work in this individual’s journey, and also formulate clinical proposals for her care, according particular importance to affective bonds: intra-family and intra-inter-professionals links.\n",
      "Maternal parenting styles and ecological momentary assessment of maternal feeding practices and child food intake across middle childhood to early adolescence. Summary Background Maternal parenting styles are salient trait‐based factors associated with pediatric obesity risk. The purpose of this study was to examine the longitudinal associations of maternal parenting styles and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measures of maternal feeding practices and child food intake across middle childhood to early adolescence. Methods Mother‐child dyads (n = 186; M baseline child age = 10.03 ± 0.89) enrolled in a six‐wave bi‐annual longitudinal study. At baseline, mothers completed a self‐report measure of parenting styles. At each of the six waves, mothers and children completed EMA prompts of parenting practices and food intake, respectively, for eight days. Results Children of mothers who reported a more permissive style consumed more pastries/sweets. Children of mothers who reported a more authoritative style decreased likelihood of pastry/sweets consumption with age, and children of mothers who reported a less authoritative style increased likelihood of pastry/sweets consumption with age. The likelihood of fruit/vegetable consumption decreased with age among children of mothers who reported a more authoritarian style, and the likelihood increased among children of mothers with a less authoritarian style. Mothers who either reported a more authoritarian style or a less authoritative style were more likely to report using food as a reward. Discussion Results highlight the importance of maternal parenting styles in relation to child food intake and instrumental feeding.\n",
      "The Shaping of Threat Through Narration. Threat is a problematic term since it is both objective and subjective in nature. It is in one sense objective, especially in a national security perspective of capability to inflict harm, but it is also highly subjective in how it is discussed and perceived. More often than not, the very interpretation of the threat, influenced by threat narratives, dictates the reality of the threat. Through the iterative process of narration and the inherent subjectivity that narration introduces, a threat perception generally evolves in a direction away from objectivity. The nature of threat narration is based on a two-part process of story-telling by influencers and interpretation by an audience. Simply put, threat comes to life and is molded into a comprehensible construct through threat narratives. This animation of the threat is precisely where it is both simplified into digestible pieces while at the same time careening away from an objective threat truth. Reconciling the impact of threat perception and its detriment to threat truth is the focus of this article.\n",
      "Secrets, Stealth, and Survival. This article combines critical theory from children’s literature studies with research methods from games studies to explore the connection between silence and childhood in two digital texts. Little Nightmares (2017) and INSIDE (2016) are wordless video games that feature nameless, faceless children as their avatars. Weak and weaponless, the children must avoid detection and stay silent if they are to survive. By slinking and skulking, crouching and cowering, the children navigate their way through vast, brutal adult environments in order to reach safety – or so the player thinks. Both games, in fact, end in shocking, unexpected ways, prompting the disturbing realisation that silent children have secrets of their own. The games use scale, perspective, and sound to encourage close identification between the player and avatar, and position the silent, blank-faced child as a cipher onto which the player can project their own feelings of fear, dread, and vulnerability. The child-character’s quiet compliance with the player’s commands also situates the player as an anxious parent, orbiting, assisting, and protecting a dependent child as it moves through a dangerous world. For both subject positions, the child-character’s silence closes the distance between the player and avatar. However, when it is revealed that the child-characters have hidden, unknowable, and potentially sinister motivations, the meaning of their silence is wholly transformed. Using aetonormative theory (Nikolajeva; Beauvais; Gubar) in conjunction with studies of ideologies surrounding childhood (Jenks; Kincaid; Meyer; Balanzategui; Stockton; Lury), this article examines the extent to which these digital texts affirm or subvert cultural constructions of “the Child.” It employs a close reading approach proposed by games scholar Diane Carr to argue that the player-avatar relationships in these games shed new light on some of the fundamental contradictions that characterise adult normativity and child alterity, and concludes by suggesting some ways in which video games might productively expand and disrupt conceptions of aetonormative power relations.\n",
      "Identifiability from a Combination of Observations and Experiments. We study the problem of causal identification from an arbitrary collection of observational and experimental distributions, and substantive knowledge about the phenomenon under investigation, which usually comes in the form of a causal graph. We call this problem g-identifiability, or gID for short. In this paper, we introduce a general strategy to prove non-gID based on thickets and hedgelets, which leads to a necessary and sufficient graphical condition for the corresponding decision problem. We further develop a procedure for systematically computing the target effect, and prove that it is sound and complete for gID instances. In other words, the failure of the algorithm in returning an expression implies that the target effect is not computable from the available distributions. Finally, as a corollary of these results, we show that do-calculus is complete for the task of g-identifiability.\n",
      "Apartheid and Exile in the Poetry of Dennis Brutus. Brutus lived and wrote his poetry when apartheid thrived in South Africa. This means he was writing either as an exile or sometime as a prisoner. These circumstances greatly influenced his poetry and continued to serve as the central theme of his message. Although he remained resilient in his unwavering hope for freedom, he advocated for peaceful resolution of the crisis, he never wanted bloodshed. Even after his death; December 26, 2009, people fondly remember him as a poet who until the end wrote about and fostered peace. Brutus' recollection of his exile and prison experiences perpetrated by the apartheid regime in South Africa serves as a good entry point into the world of his poetic exploits. Many Critics looked at metaphor, imagery, and other qualities of the language of modernist poetry in Africa apart from both a work's historical setting and any detailed biographical information that might be available about the author. This study, however, is more historically or philosophically inclined, it sought to place African poetry into a larger historical and theoretical context. The research emphasized historical development by relating changing styles of the literary representation of reality by the selected poet. The study also observes that the substantial emotions depicted or aroused by Brutus are universal human feelings symbolized by the work rather than mere copying of a foreign literary tradition, or a mere expression of personal sentiments.\n",
      "Youthful Death and Melancholia: The Case of Rupert and Mary Brooke. This article considers how Mary Brooke, the mother of the poet-soldier Rupert Brooke, managed her mourning and melancholia in the wake of the death of her sons in the First World War. It briefly considers how Brooke’s death and poetry framed and, to some extent, predicted his popularity during and after the war. It goes on to explore how Mary Brooke constructed lasting literary and physical monuments to her son, which reframed his public life narrative and reflected her own culturally ingrained philosophical and aesthetic preferences. It examines how her experience reflects established and changing practices with respect to women and public death, and the elements that made her case exceptional. Finally, it places her story in the wider history of European melancholia as it relates to war, grief and creative expression.\n",

Chapter 22 is the final chapter in the book, embracing change in the early childhood sector, and it returns to the ‘big picture’ of ECEC. The author draws on surfing and ocean metaphors, as she argues that similar to the sea, the contexts in which early childhood professionals live and work will not remain still. The policy demands and fragmentation which EC teachers and educators may find overwhelming at times, is acknowledged and discussed. On an uplifting note, it is maintained that ECEC professionals can make a positive difference - they can do more than survive during these times of rapid change, and instead they can thrive.\n",
      "The impact of childhood obesity on human capital in high‐income countries: A systematic review. Current evidence of the impact of childhood obesity on human capital development does not point in a consistent direction, and its interpretation is challenging. We carried out a systematic review of studies from high-income countries that used robust causal inference approaches to assess the impact of childhood overweight and obesity on outcomes typically linked to human capital development in economics. Global Health, Medline and EconLit were used to search for peer-reviewed papers. Three reviewers independently assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Nineteen papers representing 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. Included studies were categorized based on three components of human capital: cognitive performance (n = 18), measured through test scores; educational attainment (n = 3), through grade progression and college completion; and labour market outcomes (n = 1), through wages. We find that childhood overweight and obesity hinder education outcomes, with effects mostly observed at older ages of exposure measurement (12+ years). Girls with overweight and obesity experienced larger negative effects and more often than boys. Future research should elucidate the pathways through which childhood obesity impacts human capital development, to support policies that may mitigate those impacts, thus averting social costs that are currently widespread, increasing and unaccounted for.\n",
      "Exploring the governance and implementation of sustainable development initiatives through blockchain technology. Societies at large still grapple to categorize digital space as a phenomenon. At the same time, scientists and developers are searching for innovative methods to better understand how the fundamental shifts caused by digital change will affect the future of humanity over the coming decades. Interdisciplinary governance research at the intersection of technological and environmental foresight is urgently needed to minimize the risks of technological change and explore how digitalization may support, hinder or re-shape sustainability transformations. In this article, we focus on the case of ‘blockchain’ or distributed-ledger technology (DLT) to investigate how recent digital technologies may support the implementation of sustainable development initiatives. Our investigation is centered on areas of public administration and governance which will most likely see an adoption of DLT over the next two decades, such as digital identity, social service provision, and innovative climate finance. To allow for a meaningful comparison of various use cases, we propose four guiding questions that can help researchers, decision-makers and practitioners to determine whether DLT might be an appropriate choice for the sustainability-related task at hand. Moreover, we illustrate how the initial design and subsequent implementation of DLTs may support more centralized or networked modes of governance.\n",

We aimed to define asthma phenotypes in childhood and adolescence and evaluate the transitions between these phenotypes and factors potentially associated with the transitions. Baseline (1445 children), first round (1363 children/early adolescents) and second round (1206 adolescents) data from the SCAALA Project in Salvador, Brazil, were used. Phenotypes were defined by latent class analysis at three time points. Transitions between phenotypes were described and the effects of factors associated with transition probabilities estimated using latent transition analysis. The “asymptomatic” and “symptomatic” phenotypes were identified. Approximately 5–6% of asymptomatic children in childhood/later childhood and early adolescence became symptomatic later in time. Maternal common mental disorders were identified as important risk factor for unhealthy states. Asthma manifestations are characterized by frequent movements, especially between childhood and adolescence. Our study, by simultaneously defining disease subtypes, and examining the transitions and their potential predictors, highlights the importance of longitudinal studies to advance the understanding of the effects of social, environmental and biological mechanisms underlying asthma trajectories over time.\n",
      "The ANEMONE: Theoretical Foundations for UX Evaluation of Action and Intention Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction. The coexistence of robots and humans in shared physical and social spaces is expected to increase. A key enabler of high-quality interaction is a mutual understanding of each other’s actions and intentions. In this paper, we motivate and present a systematic user experience (UX) evaluation framework of action and intention recognition between humans and robots from a UX perspective, because there is an identified lack of this kind of evaluation methodology. The evaluation framework is packaged into a methodological approach called ANEMONE (action and intention recognition in human robot interaction). ANEMONE has its foundation in cultural-historical activity theory (AT) as the theoretical lens, the seven stages of action model, and user experience (UX) evaluation methodology, which together are useful in motivating and framing the work presented in this paper. The proposed methodological approach of ANEMONE provides guidance on how to measure, assess, and evaluate the mutual recognition of actions and intentions between humans and robots for investigators of UX evaluation. The paper ends with a discussion, addresses future work, and some concluding remarks.\n",
      "TELLING ENGAGING INTERACTIVE STORIES WITH EXTENDED REALITY (XR): BACK TO 1930S IN ZURICH’S MAIN TRAIN STATION. Abstract. With increasing technical feasibility of extended reality (XR) on smartphones and tablets, we also witness increasing versatility in the use of the mixed reality (MR) (i.e., rather than augmented or virtual) in utility-oriented apps (e.g., for navigation, indoor/outdoor spatial planning, entertainment and location based gaming. In cases where user adaptation and adherence is important, the design of the story itself, visualization and interaction in the game must be engaging, and ideally support spatial knowledge acquisition. In this paper, we briefly review the literature on creating engaging MR experiences for a location based game, and present a case study in which we feature a location based MR game (SBB Stories). We conceptualized, designed and implemented the SBB Stories with user-centered design methods in collaboration with the SBB (Swiss Federal Railways). In this paper we feature an interactive story that took place in Zurich’s main train station in 1937. Our findings from several cycles of user studies shows an increased spatial awareness of the surroundings as participants used the SBB Stories app. Importantly, participants reported the blending of historical and current visual elements as an outstanding and inspiring experience. Besides a high score of 83.75/100 in a standardized usability test, and a similarly high score of 4.25/5.00 in a standardized user engagement scale, all participants reported that they would spend extra time at the train station to play this game, suggesting that the app was indeed engaging.\n",
      "Childhood Environmental Adversity and Career Decision-Making Difficulty: A Life History Theory Perspective. Although research has examined and supported the role of environmental adversity in career decision-making, little is known about the prediction power of childhood environmental adversity for career decision-making. To provide guidance for early career interventions, particularly in disadvantaged populations, the current study drew on life history theory and used a sample of U.S. college students ( n = 310) and a sample of U.S. noncollege individuals during emerging adulthood ( n = 308) to examine a mediation model involving childhood unpredictability, childhood poverty, career decision ambiguity aversion, and career decision-making difficulty. The results support the mediation of ambiguity aversion in the positive predictions of childhood unpredictability for all four factors of career decision-making difficulty. However, the results do not support the indirect predictions of childhood poverty for all four factors of career decision-making difficulty through ambiguity aversion but support the direct prediction of childhood poverty for lack of readiness. Therefore, the current study illuminates the importance of a predictable family environment during childhood for career decision-making during emerging adulthood and provides implications for the validity of life history theory in career decision-making, the development of ambiguity aversion, and early career interventions. Implications and future directions of research regarding childhood poverty are also discussed.\n",
      "A Graph Theory-Based Modeling of Functional Brain Connectivity Based on EEG: A Systematic Review in the Context of Neuroergonomics. Graph theory analysis, a mathematical approach, has been applied in brain connectivity studies to explore the organization of network patterns. The computation of graph theory metrics enables the characterization of the stationary behavior of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that cannot be explained by simple linear methods. The main purpose of this study was to systematically review the graph theory applications for mapping the functional connectivity of the EEG data in neuroergonomics. Moreover, this article proposes a pipeline for constructing an unweighted functional brain network from EEG data using both source and sensor methods. Out of 57 articles, our results show that graph theory metrics used to characterize EEG data have attracted increasing attention since 2006, with the highest frequency of publications in 2018. Most studies have focused on cognitive tasks in comparison with motor tasks. The mean phase coherence method, based on the “phase-locking value,” was the most frequently used functional estimation technique in the reviewed studies. Furthermore, the unweighted functional brain network has received substantially more attention in the literature than the weighted network. The global clustering coefficient and characteristic path length were the most prevalent metrics for differentiating between global integration and local segregation, and the small-worldness property emerged as a compelling metric for the characterization of information processing. This review provides insight into the use of graph theory metrics to model functional brain connectivity in the context of neuroergonomics research.\n",
      "Incidental and intentional acquisition of multiword expressions from audio-visual input: The effects of typographically enhanced captions and repetition. &lt;p&gt;This research project aims to extend the line of inquiry on pedagogical interventions intended to help second language (L2) learners make better progress of their mastery of multiword expressions (MWEs). Existing studies on these interventions revealed a propensity towards exclusivity in terms of input modality, item type and learning condition. Firstly, there are far more MWE studies in the context of unimodal input, e.g., written input. It is only recently that the potential of audio-visual input (i.e., L2 viewing) has been explored for MWE learning. Secondly, previous studies have by and large focused on certain types of MWEs, such as collocations. While there is merit in focusing on a certain type of item, such studies do not represent the materials that L2 learners are often exposed to. Further, authentic videos entail diverse MWE types, providing a stronger reason to include more than one type of target item. Thirdly, many MWE interventions are investigated exclusively under one of the learning conditions, i.e., intentional or incidental learning conditions. Hulstijn’s (2001) criterion is adopted to distinguish these two learning conditions, in that the presence of test announcement characterises the intentional learning condition. Due to this tendency towards a dichotomy of learning conditions, many factors known to facilitate MWE learning have been investigated under one of the learning conditions only. Two such factors are repetition and typographic enhancement. While repetition is well established as beneficial for MWE acquisition, evidence for this is mainly furnished by studies on incidental learning through written input. Therefore, the aim of this research project is to assess how repetition, operationalised as repeated viewing, influences MWE acquisition under both learning conditions. Similarly, although typographic enhancement has been shown to draw learners’ attention and promote MWE uptake, this positive evidence is mostly observed in incidental learning studies. As such, whether typographically-enhanced MWEs are indeed learned better than unenhanced MWEs under intentional learning conditions is still under-researched. Importantly, whether typographic enhancement in captioned viewing leads to superior learning compared to normal captions is unknown. This is one of the aims of the research project, in which different caption conditions are created to explore their effectiveness in facilitating MWE learning. Of further interest is whether MWE learning under different caption conditions would modulate the effect of repetition. This is motivated by the assumption that typographic enhancement might eliminate the need for repetition. To answer the research questions, two studies differentiated by the presence of test announcement were carried out. For both studies, ESL learners watched a video containing target MWEs under one of six conditions, which differed in terms of caption condition (no captions, normal captions or enhanced captions) and the number of viewing times (once or twice). MWE learning was assessed through tests that tap into form and meaning knowledge at the level of recall and recognition. Though not part of the research questions, the effects of caption condition and repetition on content comprehension were also assessed. The findings of both studies revealed trends that are consistent with literature on MWE learning and vocabulary learning in general. Firstly, both types of captions promoted better form recall knowledge compared to uncaptioned viewing. This was found to be true under both incidental and intentional learning conditions. Secondly, typographically enhanced captions led to better form recall compared to normal captions, but only under the intentional learning conditions. Under the incidental learning conditions, the effects of L2 viewing with typograhically enhanced captions on form recall appeared to be similar to viewing with normal captions. The findings also suggest that the presence of typographically enhanced captions reduced the number of viewings needed to make incidental gains in form recall knowledge. In addition, while repeated viewing under all caption conditions led to better knowledge of form under the incidental learning conditions, the effect of repetition was not found under the intentional learning conditions. This aligns well with the supposition that fewer repetitions are needed for intentional learning. Thirdly, neither repetition nor caption condition had an effect on the acquisition of MWE meanings under both learning conditions. Finally, vocabulary knowledge played a significant role in the amount of MWE learning that takes place, especially so when learners were not forewarned of MWE tests. Taken as a whole, the findings of this research project support the use of captions for L2 viewing as a way to foster MWE acquisition, at least at the level of form acquisition. The use of typographically enhanced captions, however, may have adverse effects on content comprehension. As such, the findings of this research project have meaningful implications concerning when typographically enhanced captions and repeated viewing should be used to optimise MWE learning through L2 viewing.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "Monitoring, Creeping, or Surveillance? A Synthesis of Online Social Information Seeking Concepts. Affordances of Internet sites and Internet-based applications make personal information about romantic partners, friends, family members, and strangers easy to obtain. People use various techniques to find information about others, capitalizing on online affordances by using search engines to find relevant websites and databases; scouring the target’s social media or social networking site presence; accessing information about the target via their links or network association with others on social media; or asking questions or crowdsourcing information through online channels. Researchers have coined an assortment of terms to describe online social information seeking behaviors, such as interpersonal electronic surveillance, social surveillance, monitoring, patient-targeted Googling, cybervetting, websleuthing, human flesh search, lateral surveillance, Facebook surveillance, and Facebook stalking. Although considerable research has examined these behaviors, there has been little effort to clarify the concepts themselves. As a result, the literature is currently full of inconsistent and overlapping conceptualizations. To synthesize these concepts for future research, this review examines 73 online social information seeking concepts extracted from 186 articles. Specifically, the concepts are reviewed in light of their scope; the information seeker or target of information seeking (e.g., romantic partners, parents, children, employees, criminals); motives for information seeking (e.g., uncertainty, threat, curiosity); and the intensity of the behavior. Recommendations are provided for future research, such as employing clear conceptualizations and incorporating affordances. Finally, we offer a decision tree that researchers can use to help select appropriate terms to use in their work moving forward.\n",
      "Changes in Family Life and Relationships during the COVID-19 Pandemic and their Associations with Perceived Stress. This study explores how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed family life and relationships as well as how these changes affect perceived stress among married men and women. This study investigated changes in family time use, household work, child care, leisure activities, income and expenditures along with relationships between spouses and children using a sample of 627 married persons surveyed online from May 19 to 25, 2020. The results showed that the amount of time spent on household work, child care, and family leisure have increased and that the perceived burden of household work and child care has also increased. Gender differences were found in time use, household work, and child care. Leisure activities have changed toward more time watching TV or online media and playing online games and less time on outdoor activities, shopping, and meeting friends. About 38% of respondents reported a reduction in household income and 22% reported an increase in household debt. The majority experienced no change in the quality of relationships with spouses and children, approximately 20% of the sample reported a positive change in relationships with spouses and children. The findings of multivariate regression indicated that change in work time, negative change in household economy, negative change in household work and negative change in relationships with spouses were associated with marital stress. However, this study found that negative changes in child care and in relationships with children did not affect stress among married parents with children in elementary or secondary school.\n",
      "Effects of the number of sperm and site of uterine semen deposition on conception rate and the number of embryos in weaned sows receiving a single fixed-time insemination. Abstract Reducing the number of sperm needed to produce a litter with artificial insemination (AI) allows greater use of higher genetic merit boars. Induced ovulation with single fixed-time artificial insemination (SFTAI), combined with intrauterine (IUI) or deep uterine insemination (DUI), could improve fertility with low numbers of sperm. The objectives of the study were to determine the fertility effects of sperm numbers and the site of insemination. At weaning (0 h), sows (n = 534) were assigned by parity and estrus induction method (equine chorionic gonadotropin [eCG] or Control) to receive 1,200 × 106 sperm by IUI; 600, 300, or 150 × 106 sperm by IUI or DUI; or 75 × 106 sperm by DUI. At 80 h postweaning, sows received OvuGel and 26 h later a SFTAI using pooled semen. Sows were exposed to boars once daily and ultrasound was performed to determine follicle size and time of ovulation. Following SFTAI, sows were slaughtered 27 d after AI to determine pregnancy and litter traits. Data were analyzed using different models to test for effects of estrus induction, interaction of three levels of sperm (600 to 150) with two levels for site (IUI vs. DUI), and the overall effects of AI method (eight treatments). There was no effect (P &amp;gt; 0.05) of estrus induction on estrus (93%) within 5 d of weaning or on follicle size (6.1 mm) at OvuGel, but wean-to-estrus interval (3.8 vs. 4.0 d) was slightly reduced (P &amp;lt; 0.01) as was AI-to-ovulation interval (15.9 vs. 17.0 h, P = 0.04) for eCG and Control, respectively. There was no effect (P &amp;gt; 0.05) of estrus induction on pregnancy rate (78.6%), number of corpora lutea (CL; 21.7), or number of viable embryos (12.2). There was no effect of number of sperm or site of insemination and no interaction (P &amp;gt; 0.05) on pregnancy rate (range: 80.9% to 70.5%), but AI occurring after ovulation reduced the pregnancy rate (P &amp;lt; 0.02). The total number of embryos (range: 16.5 to 10.3) was not affected by estrus induction, number of sperm, or site of insemination (P &amp;gt; 0.05), but was influenced by AI treatment (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Treatments with a higher number of sperm (1,200 and 600) had more embryos compared with those with a lower number of sperm (300 to 75). The numbers of embryos also increased with the number of CL (P &amp;lt; 0.0001). These results suggest that the lower number of sperm affects litter size more than the pregnancy status. Acceptable fertility can be achieved with low numbers of sperm when using a SFTAI and uterine deposition, but AI-to-ovulation interval and ovulation rate influence final fecundity.\n",
      "Behavioural and emotional profiles of children and adolescents with disorders of arousal. Summary Disorders of arousals are common sleep disorders characterized by complex motor behaviours that arise episodically out of slow‐wave sleep. Psychological distress has long been associated with disorders of arousal, but this link remains controversial, especially in children and adolescents. The aim of this multi‐centre study was to characterize behavioural and emotional problems in a sample of children/adolescents with disorders of arousal, and to explore their relationship with the severity of nocturnal episodes. The parents of 41 children/adolescents with a diagnosis of disorders of arousal (11.5 ± 3.3 years old, 61% males) and of a group of 41 age‐ and gender‐matched control participants filled in the Child Behavior Checklist, along with the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children and the Paris Arousal Disorders Severity Scale. Multilevel t ‐tests revealed significantly higher total scores and sub‐scores of the Child Behavior Checklist for the patient group compared with the control group. Thirty‐four percent of the patients obtained pathological total scores, and 12% of them borderline scores. The severity of emotional/behavioural problems in the patient group was positively correlated with the severity of the nocturnal episodes. Interestingly, children/adolescents with disorders of arousal also obtained higher excessive daytime sleepiness and insomnia symptoms sub‐scores at the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. These results confirmed the hypothesis that behavioural/emotional problems are surprisingly common in children/adolescents with disorders of arousal. Further studies are warranted to investigate the causal relationship between pathological manifestations, subtler sleep abnormalities, and diurnal emotional/behavioural problems in children/adolescents with disorders of arousal.\n",
      "Avatar 'n' Andy. Despite recent criticisms that call out blackface in video game voice acting, the term “blackface” was and still is seldomly used to describe the act of casting white voice actors as characters of colour. As a result, the act of blackface in video game voice acting still occurs because of colorblind claims surrounding the digital medium and culture of games. In this paper, I position blackface in video game voice acting within a technological and cultural history of oral blackface and white sonic norms. I focus on three time periods: the Intellivision Intellivoice and the invention of a \"universal\" voice in video games; early American radio in the 1920s-1930s and the national standardization of voice; and colorblind rhetoric of contemporary game publishers/devs and voice actors.\n",
      "The effects of diagnostic hysteroscopy on the reproductive outcomes of infertile women without intrauterine pathologies: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Purpose: Hysteroscopy can be used both to diagnose and to treat intrauterine pathologies. It is well known that hysteroscopy helps to improve reproductive outcomes by treating intrauterine pathologies. However, it is uncertain whether hysteroscopy is helpful in the absence of intrauterine pathologies. This study aimed to confirm whether hysteroscopy improves the reproductive outcomes of infertile women without intrauterine pathologies.Methods: We conducted a systematic review of 11 studies retrieved from Ovid-MEDLINE, Ovid-Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Two independent investigators extracted the data and used risk-of-bias tools (RoB 2.0 and ROBINS-I) to assess their quality.Results: Diagnostic hysteroscopy prior to in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was associated with a higher clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and live birth rate (LBR) than non-hysteroscopy in patients with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) (odds ratio, 1.79 and 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.40–2.30 and 1.08–1.97 for CPR and LBR, respectively) while hysteroscopy prior to first IVF was ineffective. The overall meta-analysis of LBR showed statistically significant findings for RIF, but a subgroup analysis showed effects only in prospective cohorts (odds ratio, 1.40 and 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.86–1.56 and 1.04–2.07 for randomized controlled trials and prospective cohorts, respectively). Therefore, the LBR should be interpreted carefully and further research is needed. Conclusion: Although further research is warranted, hysteroscopy may be considered as a diagnostic and treatment option for infertile women who have experienced RIF regardless of intrauterine pathologies. This finding enables nurses to educate and support infertile women with RIF prior to IVF/ICSI.\n",

The first five years of development are a very important period in child development, because in this range, children experience optimal cognitive development. At that time, it became the right range to develop a child's religious spirit. The research method used is literature study, namely conducting a process of reviewing books, existing theories to be linked with the topic of developing the religious spirit of early childhood. The results of this study indicate that in the process of developing the religious and moral spirit of early childhood, they must consider the stages of children's development, both psychological and physical development. The development of a religious spirit can be carried out in a tangible form through participation in daily religious activities, so that children get firsthand real experiences taught by parents or teachers. Methods of delivery can be through lectures, games, stories, role playing, habituation and exemplary. Therefore, both parents and teachers need to provide stimulation so that their children can respond quickly to learning religious concepts in the hope that they can develop their sense of diversity.\n",
      "Exploring the use of AR technology for co-creative product and packaging design. Extended Reality technologies, including Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), are being applied in a wide variety of industrial applications, but their use within design practice remains very limited, despite some promising research activities in this area over the last 20 years. At the same time, design practice has been evolving to place greater emphasis on the role of the client or end-user in the design process through ‘co-creative design’ activities. Whilst offering many benefits, co-creative design activities also present challenges, notably in the communication between designers and non-designers, which can hinder innovation. In this paper, we investigate the potential of a novel, projection-based AR system for the creation of design representations to support co-creative design sessions. The technology is tested through benchmarking experiments and in-situ trials conducted with two industrial partners. Performance metrics and qualitative feedback are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the new technology in supporting co-creative design sessions. Overall, AR technology allows quick, real-time modifications to the surfaces of a physical prototype to try out new ideas. Consequently, designers perceive the possibility to enhance the collaboration with the end-users participating in the session. Moreover, the quality and novelty of ideas generated whilst using projection-based AR outperform conventional sessions or handheld display AR sessions. Whilst the results of these early trials are not conclusive, the results suggest that projection-based AR design representations provide a promising approach to supporting co-creative design sessions.\n",
      "Unpaid work and gender gap patterns in Colombia. Gender inequality is much more than wage gaps. Indeed, one interesting case is how individuals allocate time among different activities such as paid work, unpaid work and domestic work. This paper aims to quantify gender inequality in the time use in unpaid care and home activities and to investigate the main drivers of gender gaps in Colombia using the National Time Use Survey. Our results suggest that the gender gap in unpaid work depends on factors such as educational level, paid employment status, and family composition. Counterfactual exercises comparing individuals under different family contexts suggest that the gender gap varies importantly with the presence of children, marital status and individual's participation in the generation of household income.\n",
      "Learning vocabulary and grammar from cross-situational statistics. Across multiple situations, child and adult learners are sensitive to co-occurrences between individual words and their referents in the environment, which provide a means by which the ambiguity of word-world mappings may be resolved (Monaghan & Mattock, 2012; Scott & Fisher, 2012; Smith & Yu, 2008; Yu & Smith, 2007). In three studies, we tested whether cross-situational learning is sufficiently powerful to support simultaneous learning the referents for words from multiple grammatical categories, a more realistic reflection of more complex natural language learning situations. In Experiment 1, adult learners heard sentences comprising nouns, verbs, adjectives, and grammatical markers indicating subject and object roles, and viewed a dynamic scene to which the sentence referred. In Experiments 2 and 3, we further increased the uncertainty of the referents by presenting two scenes alongside each sentence. In all studies, we found that cross-situational statistical learning was sufficiently powerful to facilitate acquisition of both vocabulary and grammar from complex sentence-to-scene correspondences, simulating the situations that more closely resemble the challenge facing the language learner.\n",
      "The Effect of Work Environment Risk Factors on the Burnout of Early Childhood Education Center Directors. The purpose of this study is to clarify the risk factors of the work environment that affect the burnout of the early childhood education center director and to help the effective support of the edu-care role of the teacher and the parents as well as the operation of the early childhood education institution. The subjects of the study were 244 early childhood education center director. For the study, Kim, Hye-Kyeong (2011)' work environment scale and the Maslach and Jackson (1986)' burnout scale were used. The collected feeds were analyzed by SPSS 21.0 version using mean and standard deviation, ANOVA validation and the Scheffé post- test, right correlation analysis and regression analysis. The results of this study are as follows. First, among the personal variables of the directors, there were significant differences in the sub – variables and the entire work environment according to the recruitment type, academic ability, monthly income, and career experience. Second, the overall work environment, challenge and ambiguity were positively correlated with emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment and overall burnout. Third, work overload, challenge, role conflict, and ambiguity among the work environments recognized by the general manager had an effect on the overall work burnout. The results of this study can be used as basic data for policy support to carry out the role of the director effectively through the social and emotional support of the director.\n",

      "New Technology, Same Old Stigma: An Analysis of Feminist Discourses and Sex Work Stigma in Sex Robot Media. Scholars have theorized the technological displacement of sex workers at the hands of sex robots, but none have addressed how sex robot representations could contribute to sex work stigma. Using critical discourse analysis and sex positive theories, this thesis seeks to address this gap by analyzing the production of knowledge in the emerging field of sex robots. Specifically, this study analyzes sex robot representations in academic literature and online news articles to critically consider how prevailing discourses may impact sex and gender norms and sex work stigma. My analysis revealed that through their construction as sex work, sex robot representations reproduce problematic sex and gender norms, radical feminist discourses, and stigmatize sex workers and sex work clients. Furthermore, sex workers, sex work clients, and sex robot/doll users were found to be underrepresented in these conversations. This research demonstrates the need for more inclusive and destigmatizing sex robot representations.\n",

      "A RESTful Rule Management Framework for Internet of Things Applications. Web technologies are currently regarded as key enabling factors for the Internet of Things (IoT), and substantial effort is being dedicated to bringing sensors and data from the real world to the Web. In addition, rule-based automation mechanisms are expected to play a significant role in the effective integration of the physical world with the virtual world by leveraging a trigger-action paradigm. Although several rule engines are already available, limited effort has been devoted to rule-based solutions that are tailored to the IoT and consider rule configurability and extensibility according to application requirements. In this work, we propose a RESTful rule management framework for IoT applications that satisfies these requirements. The framework is centered around a resource-based graph, which enables the uniform representation of things (e.g., sensors and domain entities) and rules as URI-addressable resources. We describe the design and implementation choices of the main rule management features (rule scheduling, activation and RESTful operations for managing rules at various levels of configurability and extensibility). Finally, we present a case study and performance evaluation results regarding the use of this rule management framework in a set of school buildings that were part of a real-world IoT deployment that was realized within the Horizon 2020 GAIA research project, with the objective of promoting energy -saving behaviors in school communities.\n",

IntroductionThe Northern Territory (NT) population experiences amongst the highest rates of both child maltreatment and self-harm of any jurisdiction in Australia, especially amongst young Aboriginal people. This is a concern given the evidence linking child maltreatment to self-harm and suicide. However, few longitudinal studies have examined these associations by patterns of child protection system contacts that may represent opportunities for intervention, and none have identified the distinct pathways for Aboriginal children.\n",
      "Objectives and ApproachThis retrospective cohort study investigated the excess risk of self-harm hospital admissions (12-18 years) associated with different levels and timing of child protection contacts (aged <12 years) amongst Aboriginal children. The study used linked, de-identified, individual-level records from multiple agencies for 6,476 Aboriginal children born in the NT between 1999 and 2003.\n",
      "ResultsOver 70% (n=36/50) of the cohort who experienced self-harm had a history of child protection contact. The overall probability of self-harm increased as the level of contact with the child protection system increased. After adjusting for confounding, children with any level of child protection contact in middle childhood (5-11 years) only and across both early (0-4 years) and middle childhood were 3 to 9 times more likely to experience self-harm in adolescence compared to their peers in the general population.\n",
      "Conclusion / ImplicationsThe findings are consistent with evidence of intergenerational trauma impacting Aboriginal families and children and identifies middle childhood as a critical period in which the risk for self-harm emerges. There is a need for culturally appropriate family support and parenting programs to be available at all levels of the child protection system. Furthermore, hospitals should use a trauma-informed approach to assess and care for young Aboriginal people who present following self-harm. Reflections will be offered on the benefits of using data linkage for investigating rare outcomes in difficult-to-reach populations.\n",

The control functions of each structural unit and the measure of their responsibility have been determined. The types of on-farm control at the enterprise and their role and significance for the economic activity of the enterprise have been determined. Internal control is carried out at each enterprise by all economic and technical services. Given that in modern economic conditions, the main thing is to ensure the interests of the owner, the main purpose of internal control is to prevent shortcomings. One of the most important objects of control are production costs, since control over them is a necessary element of enterprise management, without which it is impossible to fully implement other management functions. In our opinion, the organization of internal cost control in modern conditions should be considered as a process that follows and is derived from the financial structure of the enterprise. And in this sense, this process is authentic to the cost accounting process. However, the process of on-farm cost control has its own characteristics.\n",
      "Impaired Perception and Neural Processing of Rules in Developmental Dyslexia. Rules and regularities of language are typically processed in an implicit and effortless way in the human brain. Individuals with developmental dyslexia have problems in implicit learning of regularities in sequential stimuli, but the neural basis of this deficit has not been studied. This study investigated extraction and utilization of a complex auditory rule at neural and perceptual levels in 18 adults with dyslexia and 20 typical readers. Mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a responses to rule violations in speech stimuli, reflecting change detection and attention switch, respectively, were recorded with electroencephalogram. Both groups reported no or little explicit awareness of the rule, suggesting implicit processing. People with dyslexia showed deficient extraction of the rule evidenced by diminished MMNs estimated to originate particularly from the left perisylvian region. The group difference persisted in the attentive condition after the participants were told about the rule, and behavioral detection of the rule violations was poor in people with dyslexia, possibly suggesting difficulties also in utilizing explicit information of the rule. Based on these results, the speech processing difficulties in dyslexia extend beyond phoneme discrimination and basic auditory feature extraction. Challenges in implicit extraction and effortless adoption of complex auditory rules may be central to language learning difficulties in dyslexia.\n",
      "Differentiated nomological networks of internalizing, externalizing, and the general factor of psychopathology (‘<i>p</i> factor’) in emerging adolescence in the ABCD study. Structural models of psychopathology consistently identify internalizing (INT) and externalizing (EXT) specific factors as well as a superordinate factor that captures their shared variance, the p factor. Questions remain, however, about the meaning of these data-driven dimensions and the interpretability and distinguishability of the larger nomological networks in which they are embedded.The sample consisted of 10 645 youth aged 9-10 years participating in the multisite Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. p, INT, and EXT were modeled using the parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Patterns of associations were examined with variables drawn from diverse domains including demographics, psychopathology, temperament, family history of substance use and psychopathology, school and family environment, and cognitive ability, using instruments based on youth-, parent-, and teacher-report, and behavioral task performance.p exhibited a broad pattern of statistically significant associations with risk variables across all domains assessed, including temperament, neurocognition, and social adversity. The specific factors exhibited more domain-specific patterns of associations, with INT exhibiting greater fear/distress and EXT exhibiting greater impulsivity.In this largest study of hierarchical models of psychopathology to date, we found that p, INT, and EXT exhibit well-differentiated nomological networks that are interpretable in terms of neurocognition, impulsivity, fear/distress, and social adversity. These networks were, in contrast, obscured when relying on the a priori Internalizing and Externalizing dimensions of the CBCL scales. Our findings add to the evidence for the validity of p, INT, and EXT as theoretically and empirically meaningful broad psychopathology liabilities.\n",
      "Planting Values through Character Education for Early Childhood. &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; The early years are an important period for childhood development. This fundamental period is often referred to as the ‘golden age’. At an early age, teachers and parents are tasked with providing the basis or foundation for children’s lives in the future. One of the most important elements is the inculcation of life values that will shape the mindset and behaviour. Instilling these values can commence when the child is able to communicate well, and can be undertaken via habituation and the regular patterns of daily life. The purpose of this research is to provide a study of value planting through character education in early childhood. This research is a literature study conducted by researchers by analysing theoretical studies related to the early childhood, particularly those relating to moral and value development and character education.&#x0D; Keywords: Early childhood, moral and value development, Character education&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D;\n",
      "Successful live birth in a Chinese woman with P450 oxidoreductase deficiency through frozen-thawed embryo transfer: a case report with review of the literature. Abstract Background Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) caused by P450 oxidoreductase deficiency (PORD) in 46, XX patients is characterized by genital ambiguity, primary amenorrhea, absent or incomplete sexual maturation, infertility, skeletal malformations and so on. But few pregnancies have been reported from these female patients with PORD. Case description A 29-year-old Chinese woman with PORD due to the compound heterozygous mutation (c.1370G &gt; A/c.1196_1204del) in the P450 oxidoreductase ( POR ) gene had suffered from primary amenorrhea and infertility. She had one cancelled cycle of ovulation induction due to low serum estradiol(E 2 ), high progesterone(P) levels and thin endometrium, then in vitro fertilization (IVF) was recommended. At the first IVF cycle, 4 oocytes were retrieved and 4 viable embryos were cryopreserved due to thin endometrium associated with low E 2 and prematurely elevated P after ovarian stimulation, even though oral dexamethasone were used to control adrenal P overproduction at the same time. When basal P fell to &lt; 1.5 ng/ml after the therapy of oral dexamethasone, artificial endometrial preparation and frozen embryo transfer were performed, resulting in a twin pregnancy. She delivered a healthy boy and a healthy girl by caesarean section at 37 weeks and 2 days of gestation. After the literature search in PORD women, no spontaneous pregnancy has been reported and only two previous case reports of 3 successful pregnancies through IVF were summarized. Conclusions It is the third report that successful pregnancy was achieved in a CAH woman caused by a compound heterozygous POR mutation, with primary amenorrhea and disorders of steroidogenesis. It seemed that disorders of steroidogenesis caused by PORD didn’t impair the developmental potential of oocytes. IVF and frozen embryo transfer after adequate hormonal control and endometrial preparation should be an effective infertility treatment for PORD women.\n",
      "TRIALECTICAL APPROACH TO SENSE-MAKING STRATEGIES. While studying sense-making regulation, we have previously elaborated on a basic personological model based on dual relations of personal traits. Their representation in the form of an ensemble of bipolar semantic scales&amp;#x27; shows two strategies for organization of the notional sphere – positive development or degradation of the personality (Godunov, 2017). This approach reduces all the variety of options for personal development to a pair of oppositions. The purpose of this article is to theoretically substantiate the transition from the dual to trinal model of sense-making strategies and their description. The genesis of personal traits and meanings that determine them is examined from trialectic viewpoint on the basis of the three-fold sense-making strategies. This methodological approach allows carrying out multifactor diagnostics and qualitative interpretation of various states of personal value-semantic sphere which simulates behavior patterns in various life situations. This helps one to realize the peculiarities of one’s being and otherness as conditions of spiritual self-improvement in the way of self-transcendence\n",
      "Family Support and the Media in Ireland: Newspaper Content Analysis 2014–2017. The objective of this paper is to inform a critical analysis of how the media portray family support in Ireland. Findings of a content analysis carried out on national and regional Irish newspapers between 2014 and 2017 are presented which describe communication about family support services provided by Tusla—Child and Family Agency. Results show that even though child protection was not used as a specific search term, news items on the Child and Family Agency and family support were usually focused on child protection and children in care. Results also show that family support activities are reported more positively in local papers compared to national papers. In the discussion, we argue that these findings are important as the media plays an important role in how the public understand, view, and engage with integrated child protection and welfare systems. We consider the implications of the research and advocate working with the media to inform their interpretation and understanding of family support. We suggest this is important as the manner in which the media communicate and frame family support as part of the overall child protection and welfare system is one of the main influences on public understandings and awareness of preventative family support and child welfare services.\n",
      "Applications of Machine Learning in Human Microbiome Studies: A Review on Feature Selection, Biomarker Identification, Disease Prediction and Treatment. The number of microbiome-related studies has notably increased the availability of data on human microbiome composition and function. These studies provide the essential material to deeply explore host-microbiome associations and their relation to the development and progression of various complex diseases. Improved data-analytical tools are needed to exploit all information from these biological datasets, taking into account the peculiarities of microbiome data, i.e., compositional, heterogeneous and sparse nature of these datasets. The possibility of predicting host-phenotypes based on taxonomy-informed feature selection to establish an association between microbiome and predict disease states is beneficial for personalized medicine. In this regard, machine learning (ML) provides new insights into the development of models that can be used to predict outputs, such as classification and prediction in microbiology, infer host phenotypes to predict diseases and use microbial communities to stratify patients by their characterization of state-specific microbial signatures. Here we review the state-of-the-art ML methods and respective software applied in human microbiome studies, performed as part of the COST Action ML4Microbiome activities. This scoping review focuses on the application of ML in microbiome studies related to association and clinical use for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics. Although the data presented here is more related to the bacterial community, many algorithms could be applied in general, regardless of the feature type. This literature and software review covering this broad topic is aligned with the scoping review methodology. The manual identification of data sources has been complemented with: (1) automated publication search through digital libraries of the three major publishers using natural language processing (NLP) Toolkit, and (2) an automated identification of relevant software repositories on GitHub and ranking of the related research papers relying on learning to rank approach.\n",
      "CONSTRUCTION OF A SOMATOSENSORY INTERACTIVE SYSTEM BASED ON COMPUTER VISION AND AUGMENTED REALITY TECHNIQUES USING THE KINECT DEVICE FOR FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. A somatosensory interactive system based on computer vision and augmented reality (AR) techniques using the Kinect device is proposed, on which a game of harvesting three kinds of fruit can be played for food and agricultural education. The Kinect is used to capture users’ motion images, the Unity3D is used as the game engine, and the Kinect SDK is used for developing programs, to implement the tasks of face detection and tracking, hand-gesture recognition, and body-model matching and tracking involved in fruit-harvesting activities. AR-based photos of the harvest result can be taken and downloaded as souvenirs. The system was exhibited and observations of the users’ performances as well as interviews with experts and the users were conducted. The collected opinions were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system, reaching the following conclusions: 1) the interactive experience of using this system is simple and intuitive; 2) the use of body movements for man-machine interaction is given positive reviews; 3) the introduction of somatosensory interactive education can arouse participants’ interest, achieving the effect of edutainment; and 4) the experience of taking commemorative photos can achieve the publicity and promotion effect of food and agricultural education through sharing on social media.\n",
      "State and Trait Anxiety of Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Objective This study examined how state and trait anxiety of adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with their demographic characteristics, repetitive and restricted behaviors (RRBs), and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors.Methods A total of 96 participants with ASD (mean age=14.30 years; 91 males) completed a battery of tests including the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and a cognitive test measuring intelligence quotient (IQ). Participants’ parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Pearson’s correlations among age, IQ, two subscales of the STAI (i.e., STAIS and STAIT, measuring self-reported state and trait anxiety, respectively), and the Anxiety subscale of CBCL (i.e., CBCL-Anxiety, measuring parent-reported trait anxiety) were computed. Subsequently, Pearson’s correlations were computed among the three anxiety measures, RRBs, and problem behaviors, while controlling for participants’ age and IQ.Results The STAIS and CBCL-Anxiety were both significantly correlated with higher age, sensory sensitivity, depressive symptoms, somatic complaints, and aggressive behaviors. All three anxiety variables were significantly and positively correlated with total SRS RRB scores. Additionally, the STAIS and STAIT were significantly associated with more severe Compulsion/Adherence behaviors, and the CBCL-Anxiety was also significantly associated with more severe Rule-breaking Behaviors.Conclusion Self-reported state anxiety showed association patterns similar to those of parent-reported trait anxiety. Future studies investigating the precise operationalization of different anxiety instruments are needed to accurately measure the anxiety of adolescents with ASD.\n",
      "Anonymity and authenticity on the web. Abstract Building on our own research ( Kersten and Lotze 2018 , 2020 ; Lotze and Kersten in press , under review ) as well as other work in this area ( Bechar-Israeli 1995 ; Stommel 2007 ; Lindholm 2013 ; Aleksiejuk 2016a , 2016b ), this article will discuss the pragmatics of (self-)naming practices online and how they contribute to identity construction and face-work ( Bedijs, Held and Maaß 2014 ; Seargeant and Tagg 2014 ). Drawing on the data collected, both existing and analysed as part of a wider study of usernames across 14 languages ( Schlobinski and Siever 2018a ), the use and function of anthroponyms and other names in online contexts are explored. Furthermore, we endeavour to situate both onomastic and sociolinguistic research in the field of digitally-mediated interaction (DMI) and in the field of pragmatics in general.\n",
      "ALTERING THE HUMAN GENOME: MAPPING THE GENOME EDITING REGULATORY SYSTEM IN SOUTH AFRICA. Novel therapeutic strategies using genome editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, are revolutionising the way in which diseases can be prevented and treated in the future. Consequently, a global debate has emerged around the ethical and legal implications relating to the use of such technology in research, therapy, and human reproduction. This has brought to the forefront questions regarding the extent to which current policies respond to these issues. In this paper, we provide a “map” of South African policy relating to genome editing, and illustrate how current ethical guidelines and law regulate its use. We find that the South African policy framework is marred with inconsistencies and incompleteness, and that an opportunity exists for the normative and regulatory framework governing this field of research and therapeutic application in South Africa, to be reviewed and reformed. In this paper we present certain recommendations – with the goal of informing and supporting health policy and decision-making regarding the regulation of genome editing in South Africa. We suggest that by adopting a pragmatic regulatory approach, such recommendations serve to address public concern, reflect appropriate international perspectives, and provide a firm foundation for the development of genome editing regulation in South Africa.\n"
