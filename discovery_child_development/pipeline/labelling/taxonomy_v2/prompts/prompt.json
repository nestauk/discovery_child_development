This is a multilabel classification task, so assign as many category labels as you deem relevant. DO NOT ASSIGN JUST ANY LABEL - choose only the appropriate labels representing topics that are directly mentioned in the text. If no labels are appropriate, return the label 'no label'. DO NOT CREATE NEW LABELS or modify the existing ones.\n Here are the {n_categories} category labels that texts can be given, and some indicative keywords or phrases associated with each label separated by commas, in the format 'Label: keyword 1, keyword 2...'. If a text contains a keyword or a phrase, that strongly suggests that label associated with the keyword or phrase is relevant. \n ----------------------------------- \n ### List of category labels \n ----------------------------------- \n ### Text to Classify ### \n ``` \n {text} \n ```",
