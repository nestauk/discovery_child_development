The current study examines relations of mean-level estimates, linear changes, and instability in income and family processes to child outcomes and addresses whether income, through its impact on family functioning, matters more for children living in poverty. Temporal changes and instability in family processes, but not income, predicted children's adjustment."}

{"label": "Not-relevant", "text": "Abstract The emulation of human sensation, perception, and action processes has become a major challenge for bioinspired intelligent robotics, interactive human–machine interfacing, and advanced prosthetics. Reflex actions, enabled through reflex arcs, are important for human and higher animals to respond to stimuli from environment without the brain processing and survive the risks of nature. An artificial reflex arc system that emulates the functions of the reflex arc simplifies the complex circuit design needed for “central‐control‐only” processes and becomes a basic electronic component in an intelligent soft robotics system. An artificial somatic reflex arc that enables the actuation of electrochemical actuators in response to the stimulation of tactile pressures is reported. Only if the detected pressure by the pressure sensor is above the stimulus threshold, the metal–organic‐framework‐based threshold controlling unit (TCU) can be activated and triggers the electrochemical actuators to complete the motion. Such responding mechanism mimics the all‐or‐none law in the human nervous system. As a proof of concept, the artificial somatic reflex arc is successfully integrated into a robot to mimic the infant grasp reflex. This work provides a unique and simplifying strategy for developing intelligent soft robotics, next‐generation human–machine interfaces, and neuroprosthetics."}

Whether these neurons are functional before animals start to ingest food is unknown. Here, we studied the functional ontogeny of Agrp neurons during breastfeeding using postnatal day 10 mice. In contrast to adult mice, we show that isolation from the nursing nest, not milk deprivation or ingestion, activated Agrp neurons. Non-nutritive suckling and warm temperatures blunted this effect. Using in vivo fiber photometry, neonatal Agrp neurons showed a rapid increase in activity upon isolation from the nest, an effect rapidly diminished following reunion with littermates. Neonates unable to release GABA from Agrp neurons expressed blunted emission of isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations. Chemogenetic overactivation of these neurons further increased emission of these ultrasonic vocalizations, but not milk ingestion. We uncovered important functional properties of hypothalamic Agrp neurons during mouse development, suggesting these neurons facilitate offspring-to-caregiver bonding."}

Nowadays, in the Internet of Things era, wearables, mobile technologies and enhanced communication and computing capabilities has led to the upsurge of innovative mobile health solutions. Many research efforts have taken place recently in the domain of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The current paper presents a thorough review of the literature on the use of wearables and mobile technologies for ASD-related interventions. It intends to give insights and guidelines to researchers in order to develop more useful and closer to market products. We searched seven databases for research articles published after 2000. Of 4,722 articles initially retrieved, only 83 papers met the inclusion criteria. Several challenges still exist in the research efforts towards the development of applications exploiting the latest wearables and mobile technologies for ASD interventions: small number of participants in the studies, non-generalizable results, technology considerations, privacy, legal and ethical issues, etc. Subjective assessment is also another significant barrier for further adoption of the developed solutions. The findings support the notion that this is a very promising sector which is expected to undergo an important increase in the coming years. There is a great need for highly customizable solutions. In parallel, researchers should focus on the importance of developing applications for the real world and not only for controlled environments. Further studies employing artificial intelligence and affective computing are needed to support both diagnosis and therapeutic interventions as well."}
