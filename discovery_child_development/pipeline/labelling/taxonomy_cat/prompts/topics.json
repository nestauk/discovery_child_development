In this Viewpoint, we argue for the need to reconceptualise an integrated early-care provision for autistic children in the light of their enduring support needs and relevant new findings from developmental and intervention research. This model goes beyond short-term reactive care to outline an early proactive, evidenced, developmentally phased, and scalable programme of support for autistic children and their families from the earliest opportunity, with timely access to later step-up care when needed. We also integrate this model with emerging opportunities from data science and digital health technologies as a potential facilitator of such a pathway."
