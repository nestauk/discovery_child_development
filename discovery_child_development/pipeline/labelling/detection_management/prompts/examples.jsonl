Children with a significant cognitive and motor developmental delay (SDD) are vulnerable for the development of (future) behavioral and mental health problems. To support children within this target group, knowledge on their social-emotional development is necessary. Therefore, in this paper, an explorative assessment of the changes in the social-emotional functioning of children with SDD over a two-year period was done. Yearly semi-structured interviews with one or more primary caregiver(s) of 25 children were conducted and analyzed on 13 domains of social-emotional functioning, according to an adapted version of the Scale for Emotional Development - Revised (SED-R). This study showed a lot of variation in individual and group patterns of change across the two-year period. Charting the social-emotional development in this target group is challenging and requires further in-depth analysis of individual trajectories as well as more fine-grained and long-term data collection."}

The abnormal infant behavior detection method based on conditional generative adversarial network and SVM belongs to the technical field of video image processing and deep learning. The present invention judges whether the infant behavior is abnormal by analyzing the motion trajectory of the infant in the video. First, the infant video is obtained and intercepted with a reasonable length. And convert it into frame images, mark the limbs and the whole body to establish a sample library; then use the conditional generative adversarial network to track the baby&#39;s limbs and whole body; then calculate the wavelet approximate waveform and wavelet power spectrum of the obtained target motion trajectory, The obtained features are classified and judged comprehensively by the support vector machine SVM; the present invention performs motion trajectory detection on infant limbs and whole body information, which is more comprehensive than single limb detection information, and the combination of wavelet domain and power spectrum domain training improves detection accuracy, It is of great significance to detect whether the infant&#39;s behavior is abnormal and to intervene as soon as possible to prevent diseases such as infant cerebral palsy."}
{"label": ["Detection"], "text": "The Impact of Covid-19 on the U.S. Child Care Market: Evidence from Stay-at-Home Orders. Stay-at-home orders (SAHOs) have been implemented in most U.S. states to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This paper quantifies the short-run impact of these containment policies on the supply of and demand for child care. The child care market may be particularly vulnerable to a SAHO-type policy shock, given that many providers are liquidity-constrained. Using plausibly exogenous variation from the staggered adoption of SAHOs across states, we find that online job postings for early care and education teachers declined by 13% after enactment. This effect is driven exclusively by private-sector services. Indeed, hiring by public programs like Head Start and pre-kindergarten has not been influenced by SAHOs. In addition, we find little evidence that child care search behavior among households has been altered. Because forced supply-side changes appear to be at play, our results suggest that households may not be well-equipped to insure against the rapid transition to the production of child care. We discuss the implications of these results for child development and parental employment decisions."}
{"label": ["Management"], "text": "Use of Gardening Programs as an Intervention to Increase Children’s Ability to Delay Gratification. The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of preschool gardening programs to help children develop their ability to delay gratification. Children today face many opportunities for instant gratification, although the ability to delay gratification in early childhood has been linked to numerous benefits later in life. Opportunities to train children in the ability to delay gratification present educational challenges, in that it competes with other academic training needs, and it can be difficult to find programs that are interesting to young children. The population for this study was preschool children ranging in age from 2 to 6 years, with treatment and control groups drawn from different schools. Participants were tested individually and timed to determine their ability to delay gratification, with promises of larger rewards if the child could wait for 15 minutes."}

To pilot the feasibility of a mobile phone childhood obesity intervention for family caregivers of Latino preschool-aged children.An evidence-based early childhood obesity intervention was adapted to have cultural relevance and a shorter-length curriculum for mothers, fathers, and grandmothers of 2- to 5-year-old Latino children. Traditional in-person group sessions (four weeks) were combined with eight weeks of mobile phone content to support parenting skills and evidence-based and age-appropriate nutritional practices in either English or Spanish. A convenience sample of Latino families were recruited from WIC and Early Education Centers in East Los Angeles. Feasibility measures were collected. Child and caregiver height and weight were measured, and caregiver surveys of child dietary intake were collected at baseline, 1- and 6-month post-baseline. Changes in child's dietary intake and BMI, as well as caregiver BMI, were examined using a mixed effects linear regression model with family random intercept and nested random slope for time period of measurement.The program was delivered to 64 low-income Latino families (46 mothers, 34 fathers, 16 grandmothers, and 48 children). Children had a reduction in raw BMI, BMI percentile, and BMI z-scores at 6-months post-baseline compared to baseline measurements. The study also demonstrated stable BMI outcomes among all caregivers.The pilot study shows promise in preventing childhood obesity, and having a multi-generational impact on weight outcomes. Leveraging the high-use of mobile phones has the potential to shorten in-person interventions, and engage fathers and grandmothers who play an important role in shaping healthy weight practices in young children."}

Background We examined absolute and relative relationships between household income and maternal education during early childhood (&lt;5 years) with activity-limiting chronic health conditions (ALCHC) during later childhood in six longitudinal, prospective cohorts from high-income countries (UK, Australia, Canada, Sweden, Netherlands, USA). Methods Relative inequality (risk ratios, RR) and absolute inequality (Slope Index of Inequality) were estimated for ALCHC during later childhood by maternal education categories and household income quintiles in early childhood. Estimates were adjusted for mother ethnicity, maternal age at birth, child sex and multiple births, and were pooled using meta-regression. Results Pooled estimates, with over 42 000 children, demonstrated social gradients in ALCHC for high maternal education versus low (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.85) and middle education (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.38); as well as for high household income versus lowest (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.18) and middle quintiles (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.54). Absolute inequality showed decreasing ALCHC in all cohorts from low to high education (range: −2.85% Sweden, −13.36% Canada) and income (range: −1.8% Sweden, −19.35% Netherlands). Conclusion We found graded relative risk of ALCHC during later childhood by maternal education and household income during early childhood in all cohorts. Absolute differences in ALCHC were consistently observed between the highest and lowest maternal education and household income levels across cohort populations. Our results support a potential role for generous, universal financial and childcare policies for families during early childhood in reducing the prevalence of activity limiting chronic conditions in later childhood."}
