Introduction Oral language skills are associated with children\u2019s later self-regulation and academic skills; in turn, self-regulation in early childhood predicts successful functioning later in life. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the separate and combined effectiveness of an oral language intervention (Enhancing Rich Conversations, ENRICH) and a self-regulation intervention (Enhancing Neurocognitive Growth with the Aid of Games and Exercise, ENGAGE) with early childhood teachers and parents for children\u2019s oral language, self-regulation and academic functioning. Methods and analysis The Kia T\u012bmata Pai (Best Start) study is a cluster randomised controlled trial with teachers and children in approximately 140 early childhood centres in New Zealand. Centres are randomly assigned to receive either oral language intervention only (ENRICH), self-regulation intervention only (ENGAGE), both interventions (ENRICH+ENGAGE) or an active control condition. Teachers\u2019 and parents\u2019 practices and children\u2019s oral language and self-regulation development are assessed at baseline at age 1.5 years and approximately every 9 months to age 5, and academic performance at age 6. Teacher\u2013child interactions will also be videotaped each year in a subset of the centres. Children\u2019s brain and behaviour development and parent\u2013child interactions will be assessed every 6 months to age 6 years in a subgroup of volunteers.

Background We examined absolute and relative relationships between household income and maternal education during early childhood (&lt;5 years) with activity-limiting chronic health conditions (ALCHC) during later childhood in six longitudinal, prospective cohorts from high-income countries (UK, Australia, Canada, Sweden, Netherlands, USA). Methods Relative inequality (risk ratios, RR) and absolute inequality (Slope Index of Inequality) were estimated for ALCHC during later childhood by maternal education categories and household income quintiles in early childhood. Estimates were adjusted for mother ethnicity, maternal age at birth, child sex and multiple births, and were pooled using meta-regression. Results Pooled estimates, with over 42 000 children, demonstrated social gradients in ALCHC for high maternal education versus low (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.85) and middle education (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.38); as well as for high household income versus lowest (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.18) and middle quintiles (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.54). Absolute inequality showed decreasing ALCHC in all cohorts from low to high education (range: \u22122.85% Sweden, \u221213.36% Canada) and income (range: \u22121.8% Sweden, \u221219.35% Netherlands). Conclusion We found graded relative risk of ALCHC during later childhood by maternal education and household income during early childhood in all cohorts. Absolute differences in ALCHC were consistently observed between the highest and lowest maternal education and household income levels across cohort populations. Our results support a potential role for generous, universal financial and childcare policies for families during early childhood in reducing the prevalence of activity limiting chronic conditions in later childhood.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "timestamp": "20240109114004"}

This document was the culmination of a curriculum development project that commenced in 1990, when the Ministry of Education sought contract proposals for the development of the first ever national early childhood curriculum guidelines. In 1995 the Ministry of Education trialled nine different curriculum professional support projects, aimed at assisting early childhood centres to use the newly developed draft guidelines. This study reports on one of the curriculum professional support projects, which the Ministry of Education commissioned from Wellington College of Education. The project which this study is based on, was grounded in an action research approach to professional support. Its core focus was the use of video feedback as a tool for critical pedagogy. It involved five case study centres: a playcentre, a kindergarten, a Montessori centre, an owner-operator childcare centre and an employee childcare facility. The project comprised a minimum of twenty one 'face to face' hours per centre, made up of eight sessions, spread over an nine month period. Video observations of each centre's curriculum 'in action', which constituted two of the sessions, were examined by the practitioners of the centre concerned, and considered in relation to Te Whaariki. Data involved interviews, journals and observations, including video. The study found that using video as feedback for the purposes of curriculum and professional development, within the context of action research, was an essentially useful, albeit complex, and quite highly contextualised undertaking. Many participants did use video feedback to help them engage with Te Whaahki, although in a number of cases the complexity of the curriculum model proved problematic. Participants used the video feedback in a range of ways to resource the development of curriculum within their centres. For a number of participants video feedback was instrumental in them taking a more reflective and critical stance toward their worplace practices. Key themes to emerge included the potential affective impact of using video feedback in examining one's own workplace practices, and the importance and complexities of the dynamics of power, both within the workplace and within the research project itself. Finally, the study raised a number of ethical issues related to the use of video in professional and curriculum development.&lt;/p&gt;", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "timestamp": "20240109114016"}

Early life exposure to Domestic Violence and Abuse (DVA) is associated with poor psychosocial and cognitive development in childhood. However, most prior research uses mother-reported involvement in DVA as a proxy indicator of child exposure; studies using direct measures of child exposure to DVA are scarce, especially among representative population-based samples. We address this gap by using longitudinal, population-based data from an Australian record linkage study of children to examine the associations between early life exposure to DVA and early childhood developmental vulnerability. Exposure to DVA was measured using police contact records for children involved in a DVA incident either as a victim or witness. Developmental vulnerability at school entry was measured using the Australian Early Development Census, providing indices of five broad domains of function and person-centred classes of developmental risk (referred to as 'mild generalized risk', 'misconduct risk', and 'pervasive risk', each compared to a group showing 'no risk'). Children exposed to DVA showed significantly greater odds of developmental vulnerability on all five domains and were more likely to be members of the three developmental risk classes. Girls who were victims of DVA (OR = 1.65) had significantly poorer developmental outcomes than boys who were victims (OR = 1.26) within the domain of communication skills and general knowledge (d = 0.29 [SE = 0.16], p = .04). No other sex differences were found. These preliminary findings hold important implications for policy regarding the early intervention and implementation of support services for young children exposed to DVA.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "timestamp": "20240109114017"}

We present a variety of theoretical approaches and discuss their applicability to the field of early language education research. These approaches include traditional top-down policy implementation models as well as more dynamic and ecological theoretical approaches. Following that, we look at major contributions in the field, presenting empirical studies from Northern Europe and the UK following two lines of research: critical readings of ECE policy documents, and ecological approaches identifying ECE language policy agents and power. Based on our review of the empirical studies, we point out critical issues and topics that need to be addressed, such as prevailing monolingual native speaker norms; how children, communities, and languages are made (in)visible in policy texts; conflicting policy paradigms and ideologies; practical challenges in the implementation of official policy; and also how national policy documents open spaces for multilingual education in ECE.

Abstract The preschool period is marked by the development of several domains such as communication, cognition, social skills, and literacy skills. As language and literacy skills overlap during the preschool period, it is important to understand the dynamics of language and literacy in early school years. Due to language diversity, India does not bear a single-language system, and often the language spoken at home may not be the same at school for curricular instructions. Therefore, the present study focuses on the influence of script in bi- or multilingual scenarios in India. More importantly, the home language may or may not have its specific script; thus, facilitating early literacy skills at home can be questionable. The study followed a cross-sectional study design. One hundred and forty participants were divided into two groups based on their native language (Malayalam and Tulu groups). Each group was further divided based on their age, younger and older groups. An early literacy checklist and a parent perception questionnaire were developed to assess the early literacy skills in second language (L2). The findings revealed a developmental trend in early literacy skills in children with the older group performing better than the younger group. The study results also shed light on this less researched domain of influence of native script on L2 learning in a linguistically diverse country like India.

Dialectical thinking is gaining wide circulation as part of personal and social preschool child development in modern society, which makes all the more urgent the task of designing a tool to evaluate the extent to which the educational environment in a pre-school establishment supports the development of dialectical thinking in preschoolers. To implement this task, the researchers analyzed the ECERS-R as a means for assessing the quality of preschool education and concluded that this tool fails to focus on rating the environment in terms of the development of dialectical thinking. N.Ye. Veraksa and E.V. Sviridova designed a tool for assessing how well the educational environment supports dialectical thinking in preschoolers (the scale of dialectical thinking support (DTS scale). The research into the use of the DTS scale was conducted in 18 preparatory groups of three educational complexes in Moscow in February\u2013April 2019. The comparison of the results on the DTS scale and those on the ECERS-R scale made it possible to conclude that the ECERS-R scale does not differentiate between the stimulation of dialectical thinking and formally logical thinking in preschool age children. The use of the newly designed tool was justified statistically. It is noted that the teacher activity in line with the ECERS-R scale scores of \u201cStimulating Communication with Children\u201d, \u201cBooks and Illustrations\u201d, \u201cUsing Speech to Develop Cognitive Skills\u201d may be associated with decreased levels of support for children\u2019s dialectical thinking in preschool educational institutions. In addition, a positive relationship was found to exist between the ECERS-R score of \u201cCare-Giver and Children Interaction\u201d and DTS scale.

Here we used electrophysiology to study how full-term neonates process an artificial language constructed by randomly concatenating four pseudo-words and what information they retain after a few minutes of exposure. Neural entrainment served as a marker of the regularities the brain was tracking during learning. Then in a post-learning phase, evoked-related potentials (ERP) to different triplets explored which information was retained. After two minutes of familiarization with the artificial language, neural entrainment at the word rate emerged, demonstrating rapid learning of the regularities. ERPs in the test phase significantly differed between triplets starting or not with the correct first syllables, but no difference was associated with subsequent violations in transition probabilities.

Abstract Background Tactile processing plays a pivotal role in the early stages of human development; however, little is known about tactile function in young children. An understanding of how tactile processing changes with age from early childhood to adulthood is fundamental in understanding altered tactile experiences in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder. Methods In this cross\u2010sectional study, 142 children and adults aged 3\u201323 years completed a vibrotactile testing battery consisting of 5 tasks, which rely on different cortical and cognitive mechanisms. The battery was designed to be suitable for testing in young children to investigate how tactile processing changes from early childhood to adulthood. Results Our results suggest a pattern of rapid, age\u2010related changes in tactile processing toward lower discrimination thresholds (lower discrimination thresholds = greater sensitivity) across early childhood, though we acknowledge limitations with cross\u2010sectional data. Differences in the rate of change across tasks were observed, with tactile performance reaching adult\u2010like levels at a younger age on some tasks compared to others. Conclusions While it is known that early childhood is a period of profound development including tactile processing, our data provides evidence for subtle differences in the developmental rate of the various underlying cortical, physical, and cognitive processes. Further, we are the first to show the feasibility of vibrotactile testing in early childhood (&lt;6 years). The results of this work provide estimates of age\u2010related differences in performance, which could have important implications as a reference for investigating altered tactile processing in developmental disorders.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "timestamp": "20240109114043"}

A different pattern emerged when distinguishing PDD-NOS from autism, with toddlers in the middle age cohort requiring the highest cutoffs.

Abstract\r\n\r\nIntroduction: Nosocomial infections in neonatal intensive care unit still represent a public health problem by the morbidity and mortality that they engender. *e most incriminated pathogens are Enterobacteriaceae that belong to the Gramnegative bacillus (GNB) family, especially in developing countries, and they can represent 51.5% of the cases. Among the GNB, Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens) is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen, whose eradication of the environment is very difficult. Nosocomial infections with S. marcescens are rare in newborns and often described as outbreaks. Infection can occur in the newborn as pneumonia, bacteremia, conjunctivitis, urinary tract infections, and even gastroenteritis\u00a0 outcome of these infections is often serious, with a heavy morbidity and mortality; whence, the importance of initiating, as soon as the diagnosis of this germ is made, controls measures before the propagation which can be spectacular. aim of this study is to share our experience of nosocomial infections due to this germ, to show the gravity of this germ, with a review of the literature\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\nBackground: Nosocomial infections in neonatal intensive care units are a public health problem because of their heavy consequences on morbidity and mortality and the important cost they generate. S. marcescens has emerged as a currently recognized pathogen for nosocomial infection in neonates, especially in epidemic for, which has also been reported in our experience. We collected 8 cases of S. marcescens bacteremia for 2 months. A similar report was published in 2010 by Gulcin Bayramoglu et al., comprising 9 cases, in neonatal intensive care unit over a period of 36 days\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMethod:- This is a descriptive retrospective study, performed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Mohammed VI University Medical Hospital, Marrakesh, Morocco. During the epidemic period of this germ, July and August 2016, the population in our study included neonates hospitalized in the NICU, whose postnatal age ranged from 0 to 28 days with the diagnosis of nosocomial infection of S. marcescens, which was made by the positivity of bacteriological samples at least 48 hours after admission to our NICU. Data collection was done using an individual record. The literature review was done on PubMed including writings describing Serratia marcescens outbreaks in neonates in the NICU.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nResults: We collected eight cases, which were included during the study period, July and August 2016, which corresponded to the epidemic period of S. marcescens bacteremia. The epidemic began in early July 2016 in a premature 33.9 GA admitted for hyaline membrane disease, which showed after 3 days of his hospitalization signs of sepsis with isolation of Serratia marcescens in the blood culture, and other cases were diagnosed throughout the July period. The mean gestational age of our patients was 36 weeks (wk), with extremes ranging from 33.2 to 40.8 wk. Newborns were premature in 75% of cases. The sex ratio (boy/girl) was 3. The weight ranged from 1130 grams to 3600 grams with an average weight of 1853 grams. Hyaline membrane disease was the most diagnosis of hospitalization in 62.5% of cases and neonatal pulmonary infection in 37.5% of cases. On admission, all patients were treated with ceftriaxone and gentamicin antibiotics, and 87.5% of cases were artificially ventilated. The diagnosis of nosocomial infection was made over an average of 7 days of hospitalization, with extremes ranging from 3 days to 12 days. The diagnosis was made in the presence of clinical signs and/or biological abnormalities on the hemogram or ascension C-reactive protein with S. marcescens-positive blood cultures. Isolated S. marcescens strains were susceptible in 75% of cases to 3rd generation cephalosporins and all susceptible to imipenem, to ciprofloxacin, and to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin), but all were resistant to colistin. After diagnosis of nosocomial S. marcescens infection, all patients were treated with imipenem and amikacin. The outcome was favorable in 37.8% of the cases, and the death was reported in 62.5%.

For this discussion we bring a brief presentation of the Historical-Critical Pedagogy, involving the social scope and the objectives of its construction, as well as its foundations and characteristics particularly related to early childhood education. We also highlight the role of the teacher, continuing teacher education and the organization of educational practice in the guise of historical-dialectical materialism. For this, we used the historical-dialectical materialist method and the methodological instruments: questionnaire, interview and observation and analysis of municipal documents for the development of the research which revealed that the teacher's educational proposals oscillated during the formative process, because now they followed the Marxist assumptions, sometimes reproduced educational practices of elementary school. We conclude that teachers lack a vision of early childhood education as a space that promotes the omnilateral development of children and an understanding of children as social subjects under construction, fruits of their human relationships, with different times to learn and different levels of development, especially, teaching that social role play is the guiding activity for the humanization process of preschool children.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "timestamp": "20240109114057"}

Investigations of early childhood growth among small-scale populations are essential for understanding human life history variation and enhancing the ability to serve such communities through global public health initiatives. This study characterizes early childhood growth trajectories and identifies differences in growth patterns relative to international references among Daasanach semi-nomadic pastoralist children living in a hot, arid region of northern Kenya.A large sample of height and weight measures were collected from children (N = 1756; total observations = 4508; age = 0-5 years) between 2018 and 2020. Daasanach growth was compared to international reference standards and Daasanach-specific centile growth curves and pseudo-velocity models were generated using generalized additive models for location scale and size.Compared to World Health Organization (WHO) reference, relatively few Daasanach children were stunted (14.3%), while a large proportion were underweight (38.5%) and wasted (53.6%). Additionally, Daasanach children had a distinctive pattern of growth, marked by an increase in linear growth velocity after 24 months of age and relatively high linear growth velocity throughout the rest of early childhood.These results identify a unique pattern of early childhood growth faltering among children in a small-scale population and may reflect a thermoregulatory adaptation to their hot, arid environment. As linear growth and weight gain remain important indicators of health, the results of this study provide insight into growth velocity variations. This study has important implications for global public health efforts to identify and address sources of early growth faltering and undernutrition in small-scale populations.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "timestamp": "20240109114057"}

Stay-at-home orders (SAHOs) have been implemented in most U.S. states to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This paper quantifies the short-run impact of these containment policies on the supply of and demand for child care. The child care market may be particularly vulnerable to a SAHO-type policy shock, given that many providers are liquidity-constrained. Using plausibly exogenous variation from the staggered adoption of SAHOs across states, we find that online job postings for early care and education teachers declined by 13% after enactment. This effect is driven exclusively by private-sector services. Indeed, hiring by public programs like Head Start and pre-kindergarten has not been influenced by SAHOs. In addition, we find little evidence that child care search behavior among households has been altered. Because forced supply-side changes appear to be at play, our results suggest that households may not be well-equipped to insure against the rapid transition to the production of child care.

Objective A significant proportion of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) will develop an anxiety disorder during childhood. Restricted and repetitive behavior severity in ASD positively correlates with anxiety severity in cross-sectional surveys. The longitudinal relationship between restricted/repetitive behavior and future anxiety symptoms is unclear. Method In a longitudinal cohort of children with ASD (n = 421), restricted/repetitive behavior severity at enrollment (age 2\u22125 years) was categorized as \u201cmild,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d using the Autism Diagnostic Interview\u2212Revised. Elevated anxiety symptoms were defined by a Child Behavior Checklist (parent report) Anxiety subscale T-score of >65 at ages 8 to 11 years. Multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputation for missing data was used to examine the association between restricted/repetitive behavior severity and elevated anxiety symptoms while adjusting for age, sex, adaptive functioning, baseline anxiety, income, and parenting stress, generating adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs. Results Approximately 58% of children with severe restricted/repetitive behavior at enrollment had elevated anxiety symptoms by age 11, compared to 41% of those with moderate, and 20% of those with mild restricted/repetitive behavior, respectively. Moderate and severe restricted/repetitive behavior were both associated with increased odds of elevated anxiety (moderate aOR: 2.5 [1.2\u22125.3]; severe aOR: 3.2 (1.4\u22127.5]). Conclusion Restricted/repetitive behavior severity at time of ASD diagnosis indicates risk for future anxiety symptoms.

Research highlights the importance of inclusive and culturally responsive teaching. This study sought to understand to what extent Early Childhood Educators (ECEs) in Southern Ontario, upon graduation from their pre-service programmes, feel they are prepared for teaching Indigenous students and supporting Indigenous families in an inclusive, culturally relevant environment. The study took a pragmatist, two-phase approach which consisted of a document review of Ontario Early Childhood Education college programmes, followed by an online survey in which recently graduated Early Childhood Educators were asked about their college experiences regarding education in Indigenous Studies. Of the 23 examined colleges, only 1, or 4.34 per cent, offered a mandatory course in Indigenous Studies, and of the 34 surveyed Early Childhood Educators, only 8.82 per cent indicated they felt that their pre-service training sufficiently prepared them for teaching Indigenous students. Consequently, there appears to be a gap in Early Childhood Education pre-service training regarding Indigenous awareness and education.

This thesis looked to explore both mothers' experiences of child protection social work intervention following an incident of domestic violence and/or abuse (DVA), and social workers (SWs) experiences of delivering this intervention. It sought to determine if oppressive approaches previously found (Douglas and Walsh, 2010) remain and, if yes, understand why they continue to be used. This was to identify positive approaches to improve practice. By using a feminist lens to explore the social constructions of each gender, map the patriarchal influences to social work practice since its creation and gather key research into a coherent whole, this thesis uncovers how patriarchy influences child protection social work, and how mothers are held to account to gendered expectations set through patriarchy.\r\n \r\nA Participatory Action Research methodology was used and both mothers who had involvement with child protection social work and child protection SWs who delivered the intervention were interviewed. Three data collection tools were created, validated and piloted for the research; 36 interviews were undertaken. There were three stages to data collection and all data was analysed thematically.\r\n \r\nFindings include that mothers perceive social work intervention to be threatening, coercive and controlling. Mothers felt blamed by SWs, held responsible for stopping the abuse and controlling their partners. SWs recognised that they held expectations for mothers and often this was to ensure the child's safety, without considering the impact on mothers. It was found that the re-victimisation of mothers occurs due to social work practice that is influenced by a combination of power, social constructions and the SW\u2019s approach. Positive practice was identified and recommendations for practice are made.\r\n \r\nThe original contributions to knowledge this thesis makes includes:\r\n \r\n\u2022 Including both mothers and SWs in the same research\r\n\u2022 The creation of data collection research tools specific to child protection social work practice\r\n\u2022 Mapping the patriarchal influences on social work to understand current day practice", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "timestamp": "20240109114110"}

Teacher's abilities to understand the benefits and use of media literacy play an important role in dealing with children as digital natives. Media literacy education can be an instrument through the use of blended-learning websites to address the challenges of education in the 21st century and learning solutions during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. This study aims to figure the teacher's perspective in understanding media literacy as an instrument for implementing blended-learning in early-childhood classes. Using a qualitative approach, this study combines two types of data. Data collection involved kindergarten teachers, six people as informants who attended the interviews and twenty-six participants who filled out questionnaires. Typological data analysis was used for qualitative data as well as simple statistical analysis to calculate the percentage of teacher perspectives on questionnaires collected the pandemic. The findings show five categories from the teacher's perspective. First, about the ability to carry out website-based blended-learning and the use of technology in classrooms and distance learning is still low. It must be transformed into more creative and innovative one. Encouraging teacher awareness of the importance of media literacy education for teachers as a more effective integrated learning approach, especially in rural or remote areas, to be the second finding. Third, national action is needed to change from traditional to blended-learning culture. Fourth, the high need for strong environmental support, such as related-party policies and competency training is the most important finding in this study. Finally, the need for an increase in the ease of access to technology use from all related parties, because the biggest impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is on ECE, which is closely related to the perspective of teachers on technology. The research implication demands increase in technology systems and connections between educators, parents, institutional managers, and education policy holders, for ECE services in urban areas for disadvantaged children, and all children in rural or remote areas.&#x0D; Keywords: Blended Learning, Early Childhood Classroom, Media Literacy Education&#x0D; References&#x0D; Aktay, S.

It is well recognized that childhood sleep, attention and mood problems increase risk for multiple adverse outcomes across the life-span; therefore, understanding factors, such as prenatal maternal stress, that underlie these types of childhood problems is critical for developing interventions that may optimize longer-term functioning. Our goal was to determine the association between disaster-related stress in pregnancy and young children's sleep, attention, and anxious/depressed symptoms. Soon after a major flood in Australia in 2011, we assessed various aspects of disaster-related prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) in women who had been pregnant at the time. Mothers rated several domains of their children's development with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at ages 2\u00bd (n = 134) and 4 years (n = 118). The primary finding was that more severe objective flood-related hardship in pregnancy predicted higher sleep problem scores at 2\u00bd years, and that a negative maternal cognitive appraisal of the flood predicted lower attention problem scores at 2\u00bd years. A cross-lagged panel analysis examined the association between children's sleep, attention, and anxious/depressed symptoms within and across ages. Results showed that these problems were likely to co-occur at each age, and that they were stable from 2\u00bd to 4 years. Additionally, anxious/depressed scores at age 2\u00bd predicted sleep problem scores at 4 years, all else being equal. Limitations of the study include a relatively small sample size and the children's outcome data relied on maternal report using the CBCL, rather than independent observation of the children's functioning, which may have introduced reporter bias. These findings highlight the importance of early intervention for these childhood problems to optimize long-term mental health, particularly under conditions of prenatal stress.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "timestamp": "20240109114122"}

To answer the first question posed a probit model is used, while to answer the second query a Heckprobit model is estimated to take into account possible selection bias. The data for this study was taken from an unpublished database compiled by the Spanish National Institute for Educational Evaluation, which gathers information from 1.166 children schooled in the Infant Education stage. The results of our estimations show that the decision to enroll children under three in ECEC services depends fundamentally on the sociodemographic characteristics of the mother (educational level, employment situation and age), on household size (if it is a large family) and on the availability of ECEC services in the area in which the child lives. Our study has also shown that the only variable regarding factors that explain the differences in the age of access to ECEC services, two or under two, is the importance that parents place on their children developing empathy towards others.

Abstract Breastfeeding benefits mothers and infants. Although immigration in many regions has increased in the last three decades, it is unknown whether immigrant women have better breastfeeding outcomes than non\u2010immigrants. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta\u2010analysis to determine whether breastfeeding rates differ between immigrant and non\u2010immigrant women.

We included peer\u2010reviewed cross\u2010sectional and cohort studies of women aged \u226516 years that assessed and compared breastfeeding rates in immigrant and non\u2010immigrant women. Two independent reviewers extracted data using predefined standard procedures. The analysis included 29 studies representing 1,539,659 women from 14 countries. Immigrant women were more likely than non\u2010immigrants to initiate any (exclusive or partial) breastfeeding (pooled adjusted prevalence ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07\u20131.19; 11 studies).

For safe and effective closed-loop disease management, the cost, size, longevity, warm-up time, and response speed need to match the performance of a healthy biological system (e.g. the pancreas). In this paper, a novel needle-injectable mm-size wireless sensing platform is presented to fulfill these requirements for an artificial pancreas by combining advanced microelectronics, nanotechnology and advanced biomaterial science. The proposed platform utilizes a sensor that is smaller than a sesame seed and provides fundamental advantages in terms of fast response speed, high accuracy, short warm-up time, and low cost of goods. Owing to these features, the system will enable true closed-loop glucose control (without any meal announcements and carbohydrate calculations), especially among infants and toddlers.

Empirical evidence shows that lack of resources during infancy and the process of accumulating disadvantages throughout childhood have important consequences in cognitive and socio-emotional development. This paper examines socioeconomic gradients across cognitive and socio-emotional measures. Using longitudinal data from a 7 year - 3 wave panel data, we study the patterns of socioeconomic status and child development in Chile and estimate how much of the wealth gap can be explained by different mediators like maternal educational and skills, child attendance to preschool and school, possession of books, or violence indicators at home. We show strong associations between household wealth and child development, and as the child grows, the gap between the most extreme quintiles of the distribution, both in cognitive and socio-emotional skills remains, but decreases in magnitude. Taking advantage of the longitudinal nature of the data, we calculate a permanent skill for each child and each skill dimension in this 7-year period. The analysis for the permanent component shows that wealth gaps are important to determine cognitive ability but not socioemotional skills. While mediators account for some of the associations, there is still a large socioeconomic gap that persists in cognitive skills among children.

Evidence suggests several important factors when evaluating book sharing with young children, including the quality of educator practice = and the nature of groupings, as well as the frequency and duration of book sharing sessions and access to books. Other evidence suggests book sharing may be particularly important for children from low ses backgrounds attending early learning settings. This paper reports on a larger study which investigated the factors and relationships influencing the use of children\u2019s literature to support principles of diversity in kindergarten rooms of long day care centres. A mixed methods approach was adopted and a convergent design was employed to synthesise the qualitative and quantitative data and interpret significant relationships and their meanings. The quality of educator practice was measured through the Systematic Assessment of Book Reading (SABR) and Children\u2019s engagement in book sharing was assessed using the Children\u2019s Orientation to Book Reading Rating Scale. Detailed analysis of 148 video recorded book sharing sessions produced statistical representations of the frequency and duration of book sharing across the contexts and the nature of involvement of the children in the study. Twenty four educators and 110 children from four long day care centres in Western Australia participated. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, video-based observations, field notes, document analysis and a book audit. The results showed that while the children in this study had a range of book sharing experiences, few of these were frequent or of high quality. Of great concern is the finding that the children in this study most likely to be considered at risk of educational disadvantage were those with the least exposure to book sharing in general, and, even less so, to high quality book sharing, raising concerns about equitable outcomes for them.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "timestamp": "20240109114207"}

The purpose of the study entitled \"Nonverbal Communication as a Method of Memahfuz Hadith for Early Childhood in MDTA Riyadhoturrohmah Mandailing Natal\" is to find out how nonverbal communication methods can introduce hadith and help early childhood to memorize the hadith of the Prophet in everyday life. And to find out what obstacles are experienced by early childhood in memorizing the hadith of the Prophet in everyday life. This study uses nonverbal communication methods by conducting training practices. The results of this study explain that nonverbal communication methods can help early childhood in interpreting the hadith of the Prophet in everyday life. This can be proven through training in interpreting the hadith of the Prophet, SA W by using the Nonverbal communication method followed by early childhood at MDTA Riyadhoturrahmah, they are very active in following the nonverbal communication movement. Of the 23 children, it turns out that there are 16 children who can memorize 3 hadiths by following the movements for 1 week of time given so that it is seen that through nonverbal communication movements they can memorize the hadiths of the Prophet. The obstacle is that children easily get bored of memorizing so they have to be more patient and repeat in practice so that early childhood children at MDTA Riyadhoturrohmah can understand well so they can follow movements through nonverbal communication.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "timestamp": "20240109114208"}
